## Extension Opt-in Decisions
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-26T00:00:00Z
**Decisions**:
- Security Baseline: **DECLINED** — Reason: 본인용 도구, 민감 데이터 없음, public repo 운영. 시크릿은 GitHub Secrets로 충분.
- Property-Based Testing: **PARTIAL** — Reason: 데이터 변환·직렬화 정확성은 PBT가 효과적이지만 전면 적용은 과함. 순수 함수 및 직렬화 round-trip에만 적용.
**Context**: Stage 1 Step 9 — Extension opt-in

**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**User Input**: "cleanup"
**Action**:
- Deleted: docs/PROJECT-VISION.md, docs/REVIEW.md (aidlc-starter meta-documentation)
- Deleted: .claude/skills/{start,ideate,init-project,scaffold,adopt} (bootstrap skills)
- Deleted: docs/references/ (template directory; copied versions live in .claude/skills/)
- Deleted: examples/ (aidlc-starter examples)
- Kept: IDEA.md, aidlc-workflows/, aidlc-docs/, .mcp.json, .gitignore (with anchor fixes below)
**Side-effect Fix**: Anchored `.gitignore` rules `models/` → `/models/` and `data/` → `/data/` so they don't accidentally ignore `src/investo/models/` (or future `src/investo/data/`).

**Verification**: `grep '[가-힣]' .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` returns no matches.
**Context**: Post-cleanup polish

---

## Construction — models — Step 4 Complete (`models/results.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/models/results.py with PipelineStatus (StrEnum), SendResult (with cross-field model_validator), FailureContext, PipelineResult; extracted ensure_tz_aware to _validators.py; refactored items.py to consume the shared helper.
**Code review**: Sub-agent surfaced H1 (PipelineResult missing frozen=True), H2 (stages dict[str, str] keys unconstrained), M1 (SendResult contradictory ok/error pair), M2 (duration_seconds no upper bound), M3 (HttpUrl serialization footgun), L1 (ensure_tz_aware duplication), L2 (enum member docstrings), L3 (traceback_excerpt no length cap).
**User Input**: "fix all"
**AI Response**: "Applied: H1 frozen=True; H2 docstring clarifies free-form diagnostic intent; M1 model_validator enforces ok=True⇒error=None and ok=False⇒message_id=None; M2 duration_seconds bounded [0, 86400]; M3 HttpUrl caveat in module docstring; L1 ensure_tz_aware extracted to _validators.py + items.py refactored; L2 enum member docstrings added; L3 traceback_excerpt max_length=2000."
**Verification**: Quality gate clean (ruff, mypy strict). Boundary tests for SendResult cross-field, PipelineResult duration, FailureContext traceback length, shared tz-aware helper, Step 2/3 regression — all pass.
**Status**: Step 4 complete; no new TECH-DEBT (all issues fixed in-step).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 4 of 8

---

## Construction — models — Step 3 Complete (`models/briefing.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/models/briefing.py (Briefing, BriefingNotification, TELEGRAM_MESSAGE_LIMIT) and src/investo/models/_validators.py (shared reject_blank_strict / reject_blank_preserve helpers). Refactored items.py to use the shared helper.
**Code review**: Sub-agent surfaced H1 (UTF-16 vs Python char count for Telegram limit, real reliability bug for emoji-containing summaries), M1 (model invariant disclaimer ∈ rendered_markdown), M2 (no date sanity bounds — project-wide), L1/L2 (validator duplication), L3 (HttpUrl → Url object footgun, downstream).
**User Input**: "fix high + L1/L2"
**AI Response**: "Applied: H1 replaced max_length=4096 with UTF-16 code-unit validator; L1/L2 extracted shared validators to _validators.py; M1/M2 registered as DEBT-001/DEBT-002 in docs/TECH-DEBT.md; L3 acknowledged for future u4 work."
**Verification**: Quality gate clean (ruff, mypy strict). UTF-16 boundary tests: 4096 ASCII / 4097 ASCII / 2048 emoji (=4096 UTF-16) / 2049 emoji (=4098 UTF-16) / mixed / Korean BMP — all behave correctly. Step 2 regression OK.
**Status**: Step 3 complete; 2 medium TECH-DEBT items added (DEBT-001 disclaimer-in-markdown invariant, DEBT-002 date sanity bounds).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 3 of 8

---

## Construction — models — Step 2 Complete (`models/items.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created `src/investo/models/__init__.py` (placeholder) + `src/investo/models/items.py` with `Category` Literal and `NormalizedItem` pydantic v2 model. Sub-agent code review surfaced M1 (raw_metadata silent coercion) + M2 (whitespace handling); user chose "fix" → both applied in same step. Quality gate clean (ruff, mypy strict, runtime smoke + validator tests). Session log: docs/sessions/2026-04-27-models-code-generation-step2.md.
**User Input**: "fix" (in response to code review medium issues)
**AI Response**: "M1 strict union (StrictStr | StrictInt | StrictFloat for raw_metadata) + M2 (strip-reject blank source_name/title; normalize empty summary → None) applied in-place. Quality gate green."
**Status**: Step 2 complete; aidlc-state.md updated; no TECH-DEBT items added.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 2 of 8

## Workflow Planning — Execution Plan
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-26T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md.
**Decisions**:
- Application Design: EXECUTE (5 components + plugin interface need definition)
- Units Generation: EXECUTE (4-5 units, incremental delivery)
- Functional Design: EXECUTE (selective per-unit — Briefing Generator + Source Adapters)
- NFR Requirements: EXECUTE (NFR-001~005 concrete acceptance)
- NFR Design: SKIP (covered by NFR Requirements at this scale)
- Infrastructure Design: SKIP (GitHub Actions YAML is the design)
- Code Generation: EXECUTE
- Build and Test: EXECUTE
**Risk**: Low (solo project, free dependencies, easy rollback via git revert).
**Extension compliance**: Security Baseline DECLINED (n/a); PBT PARTIAL applies to Code Generation and Build and Test (pure funcs + serialization round-trips).
**Context**: Stage 1 Step 11 — Workflow Planning artifact complete; awaiting user approval
