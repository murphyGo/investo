# AI-DLC Audit Log

## Construction — u139 Code Generation Step 3 complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T09:12:37Z
**User decision**: "커밋 푸시 후 다음단계 진행" — committed and pushed the completed Step 2 private-input slice as `eb6311f`, then executed the next bounded Code Generation slice only.
**Implementation**: Added Decimal-first pure functions for 1D/5D/21D/63D NAV return and same-window SPY excess return, adjacent non-overlapping 5D relative acceleration, annualized sample volatility from 20 daily NAV log returns, and 20D NAV max drawdown. Added raw-before-snapshot-quantization cross-sectional midrank/weight-renormalized `relative_rank_v1`, versioned 0/5/10/15/20-bps regime policies, historical two-axis hysteresis, explicit metric/regime/rank suppression for warming/insufficient coverage, and deterministic snapshot assembly.
**Discontinuity contract**: Every return/excess horizon requires all `h+1` SPY-grid sector observations, volatility/drawdown require all 21 points, and regime strength history requires every 22-point 21D window; acceleration alone intentionally requires only offsets 0/5/10. No missing observation is interpolated or forward-filled.
**Code review**: The required independent review found one blocking correctness issue: current and historical return-strength paths initially checked only endpoints, contrary to the approved full-window discontinuity contract. Both paths were fixed with 5D/21D/current/history regressions. The review also identified two AC-4.8 evidence gaps; 100-example Hypothesis properties for adjacent acceleration and tied midranks were added. Final re-review returned `APPROVED` with no remaining Critical, High, or Medium finding; error-contract and bounded-performance protocols passed.
**Verification**: Focused Step 3 tests 29 passed; combined Step 1 model, Step 2 adapter, and Step 3 engine tests 92 passed; scoped Ruff check/format, strict mypy, and `git diff --check` passed.
**Artifacts**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation/code/step-3-metric-regime-engine.md`
- `docs/sessions/2026-07-18-u139-code-generation-step3.md`
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation-code-generation-plan.md`
**Status**: Code Generation Step 3/5 Complete; Step 4 private renderer and manual runner is next. No new TECH-DEBT; existing Pages/watchlist dirty files, scheduled/public surfaces, and u140 status are unchanged.
## u137 Land - image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u137 code generation (7/7). Metadata-only-by-default image
candidate registry + licensed content-addressed store in
`visuals/image_library.py`, wired as a failure-isolated orchestrator stage
with a CI license gate.
**Decisions**:
- Date ledgers `archive/_meta/image_candidates/{YYYY}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl`
  (R3 union merge-rewrite, existing-row-wins, byte-idempotent) + recurrence
  index with `seen_count` = distinct ledger dates (R5) — AC-137.1/AC-137.6.
- Operator-file-driven rights states `metadata-only`/`cleared`/`blocked`
  (I14 no auto-promote, I7 blocked-wins, I15 blocked permanence); the fetch
  path re-verifies clearance/blocked file truth, not the index.
- I13 quadruple-gated fetch (`cleared` + env opt-in + policy pass + I9
  clearance URL-identity hash match) into content-addressed
  `assets/images/{candidate_id[:2]}/{candidate_id}{ext}` with
  `.provenance.json` sidecars carrying `content_sha256` (I10
  skip-if-present) — AC-137.2/AC-137.3; default runs store 0 binaries.
- Failure-isolated post-routing pipeline stage: forced-exception integration
  test keeps 3-segment publish green (AC-137.4, integration-pinned).
- `scripts/check_image_store.py` CI gate wired into
  `.github/workflows/quality.yml`: binary/sidecar/clearance pair
  completeness, clearance validity incl. I9 hash match, 2,000,000 B /
  50,000,000 B budgets, R13 secret scan, unparseable clearance = RED even
  without a stored binary; empty / metadata-only store green —
  AC-137.3/AC-137.5.
- CONTRIBUTING clearance runbook with the binding legal bar (재게시 가능
  근거가 확인된 경우만 매니페스트 작성).
- Step 0 Design Q/A ratifications carried through implementation unchanged:
  I9 clearance URL-identity invariant, blocked-wins precedence, union
  merge-rewrite ledger semantics, fail-closed unparseable-clearance handling
  (runtime treats the candidate as metadata-only; CI RED).
- Zero new unconditional HTTP call sites (httpx mock watch).
**Quality gate**: full gate green — ruff, `mypy --strict` (229 files),
pytest 3460 passed (only the pre-existing DEBT-081 pair excepted),
`scripts/check_no_paid_apis.py`, `scripts/check_image_store.py`,
`mkdocs build --strict` at clean tree.
**TECH-DEBT**: DEBT-083 (`check_curated_assets.py` authored but not wired
into any workflow — u137 Step 5 ops finding; the u137 gate IS wired),
DEBT-084 (`_prepare_external_context_image` wall-clock `generated_at` vs
u137's no-wall-clock store).
**Context**: u137 image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store Code Generation
complete (commits e93e7f0, 37b3c64, ca17a58, 0af9c7a, 54188c4, 68dd5e1,
1b3cdf3). Cross-check pending. Ratified divergences logged below (Step 1
I2/R4 sanitization split, Step 3 TS-2 digest exemption, Step 4 rollback
exclusion). Unblocks the usage-phase follow-up units (hero/link-card
selection, Telegram sendPhoto).

## Construction — u137 Step 4 design decision — image outputs excluded from publish rollback snapshots
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Step 4 orchestrator wiring — joining the image-stage outputs (date ledger, recurrence index, store binaries/sidecars) to publish staging raised the rollback question: files first seen in a run would be snapshot-registered with `previous_bytes=None`, and rollback deletes `None`-snapshot files.
**Decision**: Image-stage outputs join the publish git-add staging list but are excluded from rollback snapshots. Registering the merge-rewrite artifacts with `previous_bytes=None` would make a later rollback delete pre-existing ledgers (a re-run date's ledger file exists before the run and is union merge-rewritten), violating R3 never-drop. Failure isolation (I16) already guarantees the publish decision never depends on image artifacts, so rollback fidelity for them buys nothing.
**Ratification**: recorded inline in the plan's Step 4 section (`/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u137-image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store-code-generation-plan.md`).
**Status**: Ratified 2026-07-18.

## Construction — u137 Step 3 ratified accommodation — TS-2 sidecar digest exemption (VisualProvenanceManifest)
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Step 3 implementation — the u24 `VisualProvenanceManifest` STRICT scrub redacts 64-hex tokens, so the `.provenance.json` sidecar could not carry the verbatim `candidate_id`/`content_sha256` values the I12 CI pairing check needs to match binaries to sidecars and clearances.
**Decision**: `additional_metadata` passes exactly the two keys `candidate_id` and `content_sha256` verbatim IFF the value fullmatches `^[0-9a-f]{64}$`; a shape-mismatched value and every other key/value keep the full existing STRICT treatment. The u27 catalogue is untouched. Required for the I12 CI pairing check (`check_image_store.py` recomputes and compares `content_sha256`). The fetch path additionally re-confirms file truth (clearance/blocked files), not the index (I7/I14).
**Ratification**: recorded inline in the plan's Step 3 section (`/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u137-image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store-code-generation-plan.md`).
**Status**: Ratified 2026-07-18.

---

## Construction — u137 Step 1 ratified divergence — I2/R4 sanitization split (candidate identity vs STRICT scrub)
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Step 1 implementation — R4 routes all persisted strings through the u27 STRICT `sanitize_provenance_text`, but STRICT redacts 64-hex tokens, query strings, and long URL path runs, which would rewrite `candidate_id` and the source/image URLs and break the I1/I9 hash-identity contracts (candidate_id = sha256 of the normalized URL; the clearance filename must hash-match the URL).
**Decision**: Split the sanitization contract by field class. `candidate_id` is regex-locked (`^[0-9a-f]{64}$`) instead of rewritten; URL fields are fail-closed secret-screened — `SECRET_ENV_VARS` value scan + `scan_for_leak`, any hit drops the whole candidate rather than persisting a rewritten URL; all free-text fields keep the STRICT `sanitize_provenance_text` chokepoint plus the R4 160-char `item_title` cap. Net effect: R13 hygiene stays fail-closed while hash identity stays byte-exact.
**Ratification**: recorded inline in the plan's Step 1 section (`/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u137-image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store-code-generation-plan.md`).
**Status**: Ratified 2026-07-18.

## Construction — u139 Code Generation Step 2 complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T23:04:53Z
**User decision**: "커밋 푸시 후 다음단계 진행" — pushed the completed Step 1 model-contract slice as `08eb813`, then executed the next bounded Code Generation slice only.
**Implementation**: Added the explicit fixed-universe private manifest/XLSX adapter, approved `openpyxl>=3.1,<4` dependency, stable no-follow input handles with bounded ticker-local byte snapshots, relationship-aware ZIP/defusedxml preflight, sequential Date/NAV parsing, typed/redacted per-workbook isolation, strict SPY as-of and coverage resolution, and deterministic binary-safe input fingerprinting.
**Security and resource hardening**: Manifest reads are bounded to 64 KiB and reject duplicate JSON keys. Workbooks enforce 8 MiB compressed, 64 MiB uncompressed, 100:1, 2,000-member, 20-sheet, and 250,000-cell ceilings. Preflight follows the exact workbook relationship targets; preflight, hashing, and openpyxl consume the same bounded snapshot, so path replacement or same-inode mutation cannot introduce unpreflighted bytes. Identity or path changes fail closed.
**Code review**: The required independent review found three High issues (path-reopen TOCTOU, relationship-target cell-limit bypass, and same-inode mutation after preflight) plus two Medium issues (ambiguous fingerprint framing and duplicate JSON keys). All five were fixed with synthetic adversarial regressions; final re-review returned `APPROVED` with no remaining Critical, High, or Medium finding.
**Verification**: Focused private-input tests 36 passed; combined Step 1 model plus Step 2 adapter tests 273 passed; scoped Ruff check/format, strict mypy, and `git diff --check` passed.
**Artifacts**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation/code/step-2-private-input-adapter.md`
- `docs/sessions/2026-07-18-u139-code-generation-step2.md`
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation-code-generation-plan.md`
**Status**: Code Generation Step 2/5 Complete; Step 3 pure metric and regime engine is next. No new TECH-DEBT; existing Pages/watchlist dirty files, public artifacts, and u140 status are unchanged.

---

## Construction — u139 NFR approved; Code Generation Step 1 complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T21:05:17Z
**User decision**: "승인, 다음단계 진행" — the complete NFR Requirements and TS-1..TS-8 decisions are approved; Code Generation is authorized.
**Implementation**: Added the fixed sector/SPY universe and immutable manifest, NAV, failure, coverage, diagnostic, canonical bundle, metric, regime, rank, snapshot, provenance, and private-artifact contracts in `src/investo/models/sector.py`; exposed the public model names; established the isolated `sector_dashboard` package; and added deterministic model/PBT coverage.
**Contract hardening**: Bundle coverage is cross-checked against actual series and benchmark counts; regime labels must match axes; unavailable sectors and insufficient/warming states suppress unsupported claims; diagnostic metric identifiers are closed; dates reject timestamp strings; and `snapshot_id` is a validated typed projection-integrity field.
**Code review**: The required independent review found two High and three Medium issues. All five were fixed and the re-review returned `APPROVED` with no remaining Critical, High, or Medium finding.
**Verification**: Focused sector model tests 27 passed; all model tests 237 passed; scoped Ruff format/check and mypy passed.
**Artifacts**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation/code/step-1-model-contracts.md`
- `docs/sessions/2026-07-18-u139-code-generation-step1.md`
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation-code-generation-plan.md`
**Status**: NFR Requirements Complete and approved. Code Generation Step 1/5 Complete; Step 2 local private input adapter is next. No new TECH-DEBT; existing public artifacts and u140 status are unchanged.

## Construction — u139 NFR Requirements authored; review required
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T20:37:31Z
**User decision**: "전부 권장안으로" — NFR Q1-Q5 recorded as option A.
**Answer reconciliation**: No clarification file required. The selected 10-second/256-MiB profile is measured against the observed-shape twelve-workbook benchmark while file/cell limits remain rejection ceilings. The selected two-file behavior is specified as a recoverable POSIX transaction with one shared snapshot id, exclusive marker, prepared pair, backup, rollback, and fail-closed interrupted recovery rather than a false pair-level atomicity claim.
**Technical decision**: Add `openpyxl>=3.1,<4` as the sole new runtime dependency; use `read_only=True`, `data_only=True`, `keep_links=False`, explicit close, stdlib ZIP preflight, and existing defusedxml. Official openpyxl documentation/PyPI metadata were rechecked on 2026-07-18 for lazy read-only semantics, load options, security posture, version family, and MIT license.
**NFR contracts**: AC-1.1..AC-6.7 and TS-1..TS-8 pin private path/log/output boundaries; 8-MiB compressed, 64-MiB declared-uncompressed, 100:1, 20-sheet, and 250,000-cell ceilings; observed-shape 10-second/256-MiB budgets; Decimal-first calculation with a narrow float transcendental boundary; 10dp snapshot, 2dp percent/pp, and 4dp rank display; deterministic shared snapshot id; explicit `--replace`; modes 0700/0600; macOS/Linux POSIX only; synthetic fixtures, resource-adversary tests, transaction fault injection, and public-pipeline non-interference gates.
**Artifacts**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation/nfr-requirements/nfr-requirements.md`

- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation-code-generation-plan.md`
**Status**: NFR artifacts complete and review-ready. `aidlc-state.md` records Review Required; Code Generation remains blocked until explicit user approval.

## Construction — u139 Functional Design approved; NFR Requirements entered
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T20:31:46Z
**User decision**: "승인. 다음 단계 진행".
**Functional Design status**: Approved R1-R33, E1-E21, I1-I6, and C1-C8 without requested changes. The reviewed artifacts are now the binding input to NFR Requirements.
**NFR stage decision**: Enter NFR Requirements because u139 adds private XLSX parsing, private filesystem outputs, resource-exhaustion exposure, numerical reproducibility requirements, and a new runtime dependency decision even though it has no network or scheduled service.
**Questions created**: XLSX parser stack, bounded file/time/memory profile, Decimal/float precision boundary, atomic replacement behavior, and supported platform/owner-only permissions.
**Artifact**: `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation-nfr-requirements-plan.md`.
**Status**: Functional Design Complete. NFR Requirements in progress and awaiting five `[Answer]:` responses.

## Construction — u139 Functional Design authored; review required
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T20:25:25Z
**User decision**: "전부 권장안으로" — Q1-Q6 recorded as option A.
**Answer validation**: No clarification file required. Manifest completeness and partial coverage are compatible because identity is fixed before reads while individual workbook parse failures affect availability; strict as-of equality applies to every successfully parsed series and overrides coverage when violated.
**Design decisions**: Fixed the exact 12-symbol absolute-path manifest; NAV-only parsing; strict successful-series newest-date equality; SPY benchmark-grid endpoints; simple 1D/5D/21D/63D NAV returns and excess returns; adjacent non-overlapping 5D excess-return acceleration; 20D annualized NAV log-return volatility; 20D NAV max drawdown; 10 bps hysteresis regime with 0/5/10/15/20 bps private sensitivity; deterministic midrank-based `relative_rank_v1`; normal/partial/warming_up/insufficient coverage; and private `snapshot.json` + `report.md` projections from one immutable snapshot.
**Privacy boundary**: Paths and raw/daily workbook values stop at the input boundary. Snapshot/report/diagnostics contain no path, raw row, shares, AUM, volume, flow, earnings, public-readiness, Pages, or Telegram field. Output stays outside the repository and u140 remains blocked.
**Artifacts**:

## Construction — u139 Functional Design stage entry
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:59:01Z
**Trigger**: User approved continuation with "진행" after u139/u140 Application Design registration.
**Health check**: No Critical or High TECH-DEBT. Aged Medium items and the pending u136 cross-check are acknowledged as independent work and do not block u139. Existing dirty generated Pages/watchlist artifacts remain outside this stage.
**Context loaded**: FR-022, NFR-008, US-010, S0 private validation decision, C6 Application Design, u139 unit/story/dependency/code plan, current module boundaries, State Street 12-workbook schema facts, and prior AIDLC trust-boundary handoff patterns.
**Decision**: Enter Functional Design and create a bounded answer plan rather than inventing six implementation-affecting contracts: workbook identity, cross-symbol as-of behavior, 5D acceleration formula, neutral-band sensitivity, coverage/warming states, and private artifact set. All previously approved scope and private/public boundaries remain binding.
**Artifact**: `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u139-sector-dashboard-private-core-radar-validation-functional-design-plan.md`.
**Status**: Functional Design in progress; design artifacts are blocked until every `[Answer]:` tag is completed and checked for contradictions.

## Application Design — US sector core radar private validation and public price gate
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:50:34Z
**User requests**: "커밋 푸시하고 S0-P private core-radar validation의 Application Design 진행하자" and "그리고 가격 정보 가져오는 문제 해결을 위한 유닛도 등록했ㅇ더".
**Decision**: Extended Application Design with the independent `sector_dashboard` component and registered two bounded units. `u139` validates the fixed 11-sector + SPY domain, deterministic metric/regime policy, and private render contract from operator-provided local NAV workbooks without network/public artifacts. `u140` owns the fail-closed qualification of a free, structured, terms-compatible 63+ bar OHLCV source for public GitHub Pages. Existing `u138` remains the operational repair for current briefing price endpoints and does not clear u140's public derived-display rights or sector-universe gates.
**Stage approval**: The user's request is the explicit approval to proceed from the completed product/S0 decision into Application Design. No public provider is inferred; provider selection remains a blocked evidence task in u140.
**Affected docs**:
- `docs/requirements.md` and `aidlc-docs/inception/user-stories/stories.md` (FR-022, NFR-008, US-010)
- `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/` component/service/dependency/unit maps

- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u140-sector-dashboard-public-ohlcv-source-qualification-code-generation-plan.md`
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`
**Commit boundary**: Product and S0 decision documents were committed and pushed first as `6673ea3`. The u138 planning commit `54ea1e5` landed independently before this Application Design closeout.
**Status**: Application Design and unit registration complete. u139 is blocked on required FD/NFR; u140 is blocked on a source that clears every public-use gate.

## Construction — u137 Step 0 — FD + NFR authored (image-candidate registry + licensed store)
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: u137 code-generation plan Step 0 (Stage Decision: FD REQUIRED lightweight / NFR REQUIRED focused — new persisted ledger/index/store artifacts + rights state machine must have fixed contract numbers before development starts).
**Decision**: Authored the u137 FD (3 docs) + NFR (2 docs) in u86 format, formalizing the plan's Fixed Contracts #1-#6 under fixed ids developers must cite:
- **R1-R10** (`business-rules.md`) — R1 binding legal posture (metadata-everything / binaries-only-with-clearance), R2 normalized-URL sha256 candidate identity, R3 ledger path `archive/_meta/image_candidates/{YYYY}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl` + merge-rewrite idempotency + `collected_on` = target date, R4 `sanitize_provenance_text` on all strings + `item_title` 160-char cap, R5 recurrence index (`seen_count` = distinct ledger dates), R6 rights states + operator file contract (`clearances/{candidate_id}.manifest.json` / `{candidate_id}.blocked`), R7 clearance manifest = existing `ExternalAssetManifest` kind=`explicit-license` fail-closed, R8 quadruple-gated fetch + `assets/images/{candidate_id[:2]}/{candidate_id}{ext}` store + `.provenance.json` sidecar with `content_sha256`, R9 failure-isolated post-routing pipeline stage, R10 `scripts/check_image_store.py` CI gate + module boundary.
- **E1-E5 / I1-I17** (`domain-entities.md`) — E1 ImageCandidateRecord, E2 RecurrenceIndexEntry, E3 ClearanceManifest (alias, no new class), E4 StoredImageAsset (binary+sidecar pair), E5 ImageRightsState. Key invariants: I1 candidate identity, I4 ledger determinism, I5 index atomic rewrite, I7 rights mirror with **blocked-wins precedence**, I9 clearance URL-identity hash match, I10 skip-if-present idempotent store, I13 quadruple fetch gate, I14 operator-only transitions (no auto-promote), I15 blocked permanence, I16 failure isolation, I17 posture.
- **AC-1.1-AC-1.3 / TS-1-TS-4** (`nfr-requirements/`) — AC-1.1 storage budget (per-file reuses the existing 2,000,000-byte cap; store total 50,000,000 bytes; CI-gated), AC-1.2 license-compliance blocking CI gate (pair completeness, clearance validity incl. hash match, orphans/unrecognized extensions RED, empty/metadata-only store green), AC-1.3 R13 secret hygiene across ledger/index/manifests/logs. TS-1 no new dependency (no pillow; reuse `_extension_for_image` + dimension reader), TS-2 reuse manifest/provenance types (sidecar name `.provenance.json` pinned per Fixed Contract #4; `content_sha256` additive), TS-3 stdlib-only gate script mirroring `check_curated_assets.py`, TS-4 JSONL/JSON-on-git persistence via `write_atomic` (no DB).
**Design Q/A**: Open points the plan left unpinned were fixed as follows (flagged for lead/user review before Step 1): (1) NFR AC namespace = unit-local `AC-1.x` (u86 convention), distinct from the plan's unit-level `AC-137.x`; (2) `.blocked` marker lives in the same `clearances/` directory as manifests, and blocked wins over a coexisting manifest (I7); (3) new invariant I9 — clearance manifest `source_url` must hash to the `{candidate_id}` filename (prevents a clearance for URL A authorizing URL B); (4) ledger write mode = union merge-rewrite with existing-row-wins (preserves earlier same-day candidates, byte-idempotent); (5) unparseable clearance manifest = CI RED even without a stored binary (fail-closed); (6) idempotent re-fetch realized as skip-if-present (no sidecar churn); (7) budgets pinned in decimal bytes (2,000,000 / 50,000,000) matching the existing `_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` style.
**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u137-image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` (new)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u137-image-candidate-registry-and-licensed-store/functional-design/business-rules.md` (new)

- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (u137 FD/NFR columns → Complete; Notes gained doc paths)
**Status**: FD/NFR authored 2026-07-18; u137 Step 0 deliverables complete (plan checkbox ticked by the main session). Code Generation remains Backlog pending Step 1 dispatch.
**Context**: Real-image track slice 2. u136 (candidate input) landed 2026-07-18; binding legal posture per the plan's Problem Statement — metadata for everything, binaries only with operator clearance; `EXTERNAL_IMAGE_SCRAPING_ENABLED` default and u86 curated policy unchanged.

## u136 Land - feed-image-metadata-harvest
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u136 code generation (5/5). Media RSS image metadata
harvest wired into yonhap-market / yahoo-finance-news / theblock-crypto via
the shared `sources/_feed_media.py` helper.
**Decisions**:
- Added `MEDIA_NS`/`MEDIA_CONTENT`/`MEDIA_THUMBNAIL`/`MEDIA_CREDIT` constants
  in `_xml_namespaces.py` and the pure `extract_feed_image` helper
  (Fixed Contract #2; media:content preferred over media:thumbnail, first
  accepted candidate only, http(s)-only, URL/credit caps).
- Emitted Contract #3 raw_metadata keys `image_url`/`image_width`/
  `image_height`/`image_mime`/`image_credit` (R8 strings/ints; absent image =
  absent keys) from the three verified adapters only (AC-136.1, AC-136.5).
- Pinned Contract #4 license-key non-pollution with manifest-level regression
  tests: adapters never emit license/attribution/author/allowed_use keys, so
  `external_image._manifest_from_item` stays None and the dormant fetch path
  cannot trigger from harvested metadata even with
  `INVESTO_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_ASSETS=1` (AC-136.3).
- Extended the aggregator per-source "source returned" record with
  `image_items=<n>` (Contract #6; no new KPI/severity — AC-136.4).

## Construction — u136 Fixed Contract #2 divergence ratified (yahoo media:content image gate)
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Step 3 implementation (2026-07-17) — the live `yahoo-finance-news` feed's `<media:content>` elements carry no `type` attribute and extension-less zenfs CDN content-hash URLs, so the plan's "image mime OR image extension" acceptance gate matched zero Yahoo images and AC-136.1 was unachievable for that adapter.
**Decision**: Extend `_is_image_content` with a third acceptance path — `type` absent + positive-integer `width`+`height` attribute pair. False-positive risk is low because video enclosures do carry a `type` attribute; non-image mimes (`video/*` etc.) are still skipped and the mime/extension paths are unchanged. Precedent: the L6.5 pubDate-format divergence (spec adjusted to verified live-feed reality at implementation time).
**Ratification**: recorded in the `src/investo/sources/_feed_media.py` module docstring and inline in the plan's Step 3 section (`/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u136-feed-image-metadata-harvest-code-generation-plan.md`).
**Status**: Ratified 2026-07-18 (decision made 2026-07-17 at Step 3).

## Construction — u136 recording-time fact: Yahoo media:credit empty in 2026-07-16 recording
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Step 3 R10 fixture re-recording for `yahoo-finance-news`.
**Decision**: Record the fact — every `<media:credit>` element in the 2026-07-16 Yahoo recording is empty, so `image_credit` is absent from replayed Yahoo items (Contract #3: absent field = absent key; conforming behavior, not a defect). The credit→`image_credit` mapping is therefore pinned via synthetic XML instead of the live recording.
**Status**: Informational — no code divergence; re-recording may later capture a non-empty credit and exercise the mapping against live bytes.

## u118 Land - briefing-generation-side-effect-boundary
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-25T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u118 code generation. Briefing generation now has an
explicit request/result boundary while preserving the legacy public wrapper.
**Decisions**:
- Added immutable `GenerationInput` and `GenerationResult` contracts in the
  briefing layer.
- Introduced `generate_briefing_from_input(...) -> GenerationResult` as the
  canonical API and kept `generate_briefing(...) -> Briefing` compatible.
- Required explicit `WatchlistConfig` at the canonical API boundary; the
  legacy wrapper remains the only generation entry point with a watchlist-load
  fallback.
- Returned macro lineage through `GenerationResult.macro_lineage` in production
  and kept `macro_lineage_out` as wrapper-only compatibility.
- Skipped LLM loop extraction because the shared helper did not improve clarity
  enough to justify weakening the explicit Stage 1/Stage 2 validation paths.
**Quality gate**: 129 focused briefing/orchestrator/integration tests passed,
scoped ruff passed, scoped ruff format check passed, `mypy src` passed, full
pytest passed, `mkdocs build --strict` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u123 Land - body-evidence-attribution-reconciliation
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-26T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u123 code generation. Reconciled rendered markdown evidence
back into existing quality metadata by counting public known-source links and
verified u55 core facts after reader formatting.
**Decisions**:
- Kept Functional Design and NFR Requirements skipped because this is a bounded
  deterministic quality-accounting refinement over existing u54/u65/u96 paths.
- Added `publisher.evidence_accounting` as a pure post-render helper and reused
  it from publish, replay, and quality-consistency gates.
- Rewrote `본문 사용 미집계/0` before archive writes when rendered public evidence
  exists, without changing severity decisions.
- Preserved broad `figures_presence` semantics and populated `figures_verified`
  from rendered u55 core facts.
- Addressed delegated review findings: routed `QualityConsistencyError` as a
  publish failure, capped `본문 사용` by successful source count, added
  source-spec offline label matching, and anchored source-count rewrites.
**Quality gate**: 155 focused tests passed, scoped ruff passed, scoped format
check passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.
**Context**: u123 body-evidence-attribution-reconciliation Code Generation

## u117 Land - model-contract-invariants-and-typed-metadata
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u117 code generation. Foundation model invariants and
macro metadata parsing now fail loudly at shared boundaries.
**Decisions**:
- Enforced `SourceOutcome` cross-field invariants in `__post_init__` so direct
  construction cannot bypass factory assumptions.
- Kept adapter `raw_metadata` flat and added `MacroMetadataView` as the typed
  parse boundary in `models.macro`.
- Added a single `MacroMetadataIssue`/`MacroMetadataIssueCode` surface for
  invalid macro status, priority, date, and required-section metadata.
- Refactored existing macro helper APIs through the view while keeping their
  public names and compatible return values.
- Addressed code-review findings by preserving explicit required-actual
  default sections and avoiding false date issues for release-period strings.
**Quality gate**: 302 focused model/macro/source tests passed, scoped ruff
passed, scoped ruff format check passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u116 Land - repo-quality-guardrails-ci
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u116 code generation. Repository quality checks now run
through a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow and strengthened local guard
scripts/tests.
**Decisions**:
- Added `.github/workflows/quality.yml` for PR, `main` push, and manual
  quality validation with read-only contents permission and no secrets.
- Switched Anthropic dependency scanning from pseudo TOML headers to stdlib
  `tomllib` parsing of PEP 621 dependency arrays, including optional
  dependency groups and malformed-TOML fail-closed behavior.
- Populated the paid-API guard with a narrow paid-first provider blocklist
  while allowing current official/free provider key shapes.
- Extended the module-boundary test from the `publisher`/`visuals` pair to all
  top-level adapter-package sibling imports with explicit allowlist reasons.
- Addressed code-review findings by covering `from investo import <adapter>`
  and package-relative sibling import bypass forms.
- Normalized full-repo formatting because the new workflow enforces
  `ruff format --check src tests scripts`.
**Quality gate**: focused guard tests passed (40), full ruff check passed, full
ruff format check passed, `mypy src` passed, both guard scripts exited 0, full
pytest passed (3170).
**TECH-DEBT**: None.
**Context**: u116 repo-quality-guardrails-ci Code Generation complete.

## u115 Land - source-spec-registry-unification
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u115 code generation. Production source metadata is now
single-sourced in `_internal.source_specs`.
**Decisions**:
- Added immutable `SourceSpec` descriptors for all registered production
  adapters without importing `sources` or `briefing` from the descriptor module.
- Derived `ADAPTER_TIERS`, aggregator market-window sets, and briefing
  segment/outcome membership sets from the descriptor registry.
- Preserved explicit adapter imports, unknown stub fallback tier/window
  behavior, CFTC contract-group routing, `treasury-rates` fan-out, and
  `stooq-price` US-window plus crypto-outcome relevance.
**Quality gate**: 175 focused source/segment tests passed, scoped ruff passed,
`mypy src` passed.

## u114 Land - shared-domain-contract-boundary
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u114 code generation. Shared briefing vocabulary is now
owned by `models` or `_internal`; `briefing` behavior modules keep
compatibility re-exports where legacy callers need them.
**Decisions**:
- Promoted `TimeState`, segment labels/coverage DTOs, market-anchor DTOs and
  label lookup, core-fact metadata key formatting, watchlist DTOs/public
  projections, and first-viewport extraction prefixes/helpers to canonical
  shared owners.
- Kept segment routing, coverage construction, watchlist config/matching,
  watchlist grouping, and first-viewport validation behavior in `briefing`.
- Added `_internal.watchlist_matching` so `visuals.curated` can reuse the pure
  matcher without depending on `briefing.watchlist`.
- Added AST boundary tests to block future `models -> briefing` and
  sibling-unit shared-vocabulary imports.
**Quality gate**: 164 focused compatibility/boundary tests passed, 1188
extended unit tests passed, scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## Construction — u105 macro-actual-source-of-record Complete (7/7)
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-18T18:37:55+09:00
**Trigger**: Continue source-expansion implementation after u104 was pushed.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u105 (7/7). Added `bls-macro-actuals` for BLS Public Data API actuals and `bea-macro-actuals` for BEA NIPA actuals. BLS uses the official no-key endpoint; BEA requires `BEA_API_KEY` and degrades with terminal `SourceFetchError` before HTTP when the key is missing.
**Implementation**: BLS covers CPI, core CPI, nonfarm payrolls, unemployment, average hourly earnings, labor-force participation, PPI, and JOLTS. BEA covers GDP, PCE, and core PCE from bounded NIPA table/line configuration. Official actual rows emit compact `macro` items with source-period `macro_event_key`, `macro_event_status=actual`, `macro_priority=P1`, `actual_value`, optional `prior_value`, `release_period`, `unit`, `source_url`, and `observed_at`; no consensus, forecast, surprise, or forced `required_macro_actual` fields are synthesized. FRED calendar rows now stamp matching source-period keys for CPI/PPI/NFP/GDP/PCE so u59 lifecycle can collapse scheduled + actual rows without inventing release dates from actual endpoints. `BEA_API_KEY` was added to the redaction chokepoint.
**Verification**: `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_bls_macro_actuals.py tests/unit/sources/test_bea_macro_actuals.py tests/unit/sources/test_fred_economic_calendar.py tests/unit/briefing/test_macro_carryover.py -q` => 48 passed. `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py tests/unit/sources/test_aggregator.py -q` => 66 passed. `uv run pytest tests/unit/_internal/test_redaction.py tests/unit/sources/test_no_paid_apis.py -q` => 59 passed. `uv run ruff check src/investo/sources/bls_macro_actuals.py src/investo/sources/bea_macro_actuals.py src/investo/sources/fred_economic_calendar.py tests/unit/sources/test_bls_macro_actuals.py tests/unit/sources/test_bea_macro_actuals.py tests/unit/briefing/test_macro_carryover.py` => clean. `uv run mypy --strict src/investo/sources src/investo/briefing` => clean over 100 source files. `uv run python scripts/check_no_paid_apis.py` => clean. `git diff --check` => clean.
**Status**: u105 complete. FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next unit: u106 money-energy-volatility-source-expansion.

## u113 Land - publish-transaction-atomicity
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u113 code generation. Watchlist publish pages are now
pre-snapshotted before mutation and written through the shared atomic writer.
**Decisions**:
- Added watchlist path-planning helpers for per-term pages, the index page, and
  the daily impact page so the publish stage can snapshot before writing.
- Reused `investo._internal._io.write_atomic` for watchlist page writes instead
  of adding another atomic helper.
- Preserved writer-returned paths for git staging while moving rollback
  snapshots ahead of watchlist side effects.
**Quality gate**: 110 focused watchlist/orchestrator tests passed, 21 focused
writer/io tests passed, scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## Construction — u104 sec-company-facts-and-symbol-directory Complete (9/9)
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-18T18:15:39+09:00
**Trigger**: Continue source-expansion implementation after u103 was pushed.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u104 (9/9). Added `sec-company-facts` for bounded SEC submissions/companyfacts and `nasdaq-symbol-directory` for official Nasdaq Trader symbol-directory metadata. The SEC adapter is env-configurable via `INVESTO_SEC_COMPANY_CIKS`, defaults to the existing mega-cap watchlist bundle, caps to 8 companies, uses the SEC fair-access User-Agent, spaces SEC requests, runs under a 20s adapter-level budget, and emits one compact source item per company. The Nasdaq adapter is env-configurable via `INVESTO_NASDAQ_SYMBOLS`, defaults to a bounded watchlist/listing set, fetches only `nasdaqlisted.txt` and `otherlisted.txt`, and emits filtered listing/ETF/test-issue/financial-status metadata.
**Implementation**: The SEC concept allow-list is fixed to revenue, net income, diluted EPS, assets, liabilities, operating cash flow, and shares outstanding. Source items carry compact `macro` summaries only, so static reference context cannot satisfy required `news` coverage or item-count thresholds; no raw SEC payload, headers, cookies, or long filing excerpts are rendered. SEC per-company fetch failures are isolated unless every configured company fails. Both adapters are registered in imports, tier maps, New York market-window routing, US segment routing, and plugin contract tests. Official fixtures and metadata were recorded under `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/sec-company-facts/` and `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/nasdaq-symbol-directory/`.
**Verification**: Code review subagents found blocking issues; they were fixed before close: static company/listing reference items now emit as `macro` instead of `news`, static references are excluded from item-count thresholds, and SEC company-facts requests are rate-spaced plus adapter-budgeted. `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_sec_company_facts.py tests/unit/sources/test_nasdaq_symbol_directory.py tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py -q` => 25 passed. `uv run pytest tests/unit/briefing/test_segments*.py -q` => 85 passed. `uv run pytest tests/unit/briefing tests/unit/publisher -q -k 'fact or watchlist or source'` => 169 passed, 1154 deselected. `uv run ruff check src/investo/sources tests/unit/sources tests/unit/briefing/test_segments.py src/investo/briefing/segments.py` => clean. `uv run mypy --strict src/investo/sources src/investo/briefing` => clean over 98 source files. `uv run python scripts/check_no_paid_apis.py` => clean.
**Status**: u104 complete. FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next unit: u105 macro-actual-source-of-record.

## Construction — u103 official-policy-speech-rss-sources Complete (9/9)
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-18T18:03:29+09:00
**Trigger**: Continue source-expansion implementation after u102 registry guardrails landed and were pushed.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u103 (9/9). Added two official no-key RSS adapters: `fed-speech-rss` for Federal Reserve speeches/testimony and `sec-newsroom-rss` for SEC newsroom press releases plus speeches/statements. Both use `retry_get`, `defusedxml`, sanitized title/summary fields, RFC 822 timestamp parsing to UTC, per-window filtering, official-source metadata, S-tier registration, New York market windows, and explicit US segment routing.
**Implementation**: `sec-newsroom-rss` stamps u58-compatible `policy_priority=crypto_regulation` only when the item text matches crypto-policy terms, so generic SEC items route to `us-equity` while explicit crypto-policy items route to `crypto` through the existing metadata override. Recorded real fixtures and metadata under `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/fed-speech-rss/` and `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/sec-newsroom-rss/`. Plugin contract count moved 34 -> 36.
**Verification**: Code review subagent found two High issues; both were fixed before close: SEC newsroom requests now carry the fair-access User-Agent and generic non-crypto `market structure` items no longer receive crypto-policy metadata. `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_fed_speech_rss.py tests/unit/sources/test_sec_newsroom_rss.py tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py -q` => 30 passed. `uv run pytest tests/unit/briefing/test_segments*.py -q` => 83 passed. `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_aggregator.py -q` => 51 passed. `uv run ruff check src/investo/sources tests/unit/sources tests/unit/briefing/test_segments_exclusivity.py src/investo/briefing/segments.py` => clean. `uv run python scripts/check_no_paid_apis.py` => clean.
**Status**: u103 complete. FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next unit: u104 sec-company-facts-and-symbol-directory.

## Construction — u102 source-adapter-registry-completeness Complete (6/6)
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-18T17:42:44+09:00
**Trigger**: Source-expansion review follow-up and user approval to continue development with per-unit commit/push. u102 hardens source registry completeness before u103-u107 add new adapters.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u102 (6/6). Added loud contract tests so every registered production source adapter must have an explicit `ADAPTER_TIERS` entry, no stale production tier entry, explicit segment routing through exactly one single-segment set or the shared-source map, and market-clock registration for US-only / crypto-only source sets. Preserved the non-production fallback path: unknown test stubs still return `DEFAULT_TIER` and emit an INFO diagnostic.
**Implementation**: Fixed existing registry omissions surfaced by the tests. `tiers.py` now explicitly classifies `alternative-fng`, `coingecko-global-market`, `bybit-derivatives`, `okx-derivatives`, and `stooq-kr-market`, and removed stale `coingecko-events`. `aggregator.py` now assigns UTC crypto windows to the crypto-native indicator adapters and New York windows to `fed-board-leadership` / `stooq-price`. `segments.py` now makes the `stooq-price` crypto outcome exception explicit via `_OUTCOME_EXTRA_SOURCES_BY_SEGMENT`. No new external source, dependency, secret, API key, or reader-facing markdown feature was introduced.
**Verification**: Code review subagent reported no blocking issues; one Medium and one Low registry-completeness hardening suggestion were both addressed before close. `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py tests/unit/sources/test_aggregator.py tests/unit/sources/test_tiers.py tests/unit/briefing/test_segments*.py -q` => 148 passed. `uv run ruff check tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py tests/unit/sources/test_aggregator.py tests/unit/sources/test_tiers.py src/investo/sources src/investo/briefing/segments.py` => clean.
**Status**: u102 complete. FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next unit: u103 official-policy-speech-rss-sources.

## Construction — u87 watchpoint-matrix-rehabilitation Complete (5/5 — §⑥ matrix rehabilitated)
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-04T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u87 Code Generation landed (developer in isolated worktree, integrated to main by the lead/main session). Closes the unit registered earlier today.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u87 (5/5). Two production files only. `publisher/watchpoint_matrix.py`: (i) `_is_observation_bullet` + `_DIAGNOSTIC_LINE_RE = ^`?[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`?\s*[:：]` pre-filter drops trace-footer `input_hash`/`stage1_hash`/`stage2_hash` diagnostics and bare-link/pure-symbol bullets before row building (AC-87.1); (ii) `_short_signal` unwraps markdown links via `_MD_LINK_RE` — **also applied at `_escape_cell`** because AC-87.2 requires *every* cell (not just the signal) to be free of `](http`, and the 현재/trigger/implication cells use raw clause text (a justified in-file extension of the plan); (iii) `_TRAILING_PARTICLE_RE` trims a dangling Korean 조사 so a signal never ends on `…원이`/`…구도가` (AC-87.3); (iv) an all-`데이터부족`/empty result collapses to a single pinned `DATA_LIMITED_NOTE` blockquote (`> **관전 포인트**: 구조화 가능한 관찰 신호가 부족합니다 — 본문 §②·§④ 참조`) instead of a ≥2-row wall (AC-87.4). `briefing/prompts.py`: §⑥ Stage-2 rule now mandates the `source + (상방/하방) trigger + implication` bullet shape `_is_structured` requires, with one populatable + one rejected example (AC-87.5). u64 `_is_structured`/regexes + the closed `{높음,보통,낮음,데이터부족}` enum reused UNCHANGED; u56 compliance scanning and the `segment_reader_format.py` pass ordering untouched; module boundary intact (publisher-only, no `briefing/` import). Transform stays pure `str -> str`, idempotent for both the matrix-header and `DATA_LIMITED_NOTE` states, byte-preserving outside §⑥ + disclaimer (AC-87.7).
**Verification**: worktree base = main HEAD `63118df`; the two production files + tests byte-disjoint from main → clean 3-way apply (runtime `site_docs/watchlist/daily.md`/`coverage.jsonl` excluded). Full gate re-run on main: ruff clean, ruff-format clean (changed scope), mypy --strict clean (2 files), **pytest 2868 passed** (+9 over the 2859 rebased baseline: 7 AC-87 fixtures in `test_watchpoint_matrix.py` + 1 §⑥ rule in `test_prompts.py` + net), mkdocs build --strict pass. AC-87.1..87.7 each pinned by a dedicated test.
**Status**: u87 complete (5/5). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. **DEBT-074 resolved-by-u87** — moved to Resolved Items (Low count 33→32); the originally-suggested typed-evidence plumbing was NOT needed (the reader-facing defect closes by fixing the prompt + the deterministic pre-filter/collapse). No new TECH-DEBT. One residual noted in the summary (a *mixed* structured/unstructured §⑥ still renders the unstructured rows as `데이터부족` inside a populated table — collapse fires only when ALL rows are data-limited); left unfiled as low-value residual of the now-resolved DEBT-074.

## Planning — u87 watchpoint-matrix-rehabilitation Registered (backlog, READY)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-31T01:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: briefing-unit-planner review of the 2026-05-26 generated briefings (all three segments) — the §⑥ "오늘의 관전 포인트" matrix is dead/leaky across every segment. User selected u87 (priority 1 of the derived candidate set u87–u91) for formal registration + code-gen plan.
**Decision**: Register **u87 watchpoint-matrix-rehabilitation** as backlog (READY — no blocked prerequisite). Scope = three reader-facing §⑥ defects with root causes verified in source: (D1) 100% `데이터부족` because `watchpoint_matrix._is_structured` (the u64 source+trigger+implication contract) rejects every short LLM bullet → universal `data_limited` (this is **DEBT-074**); (D1b) `_short_signal` truncates markdown-link bullets mid-URL (`[AAPL](https://www.nasdaq.com/…`) and leaves dangling Korean particles (`…원이`); (D1c) `_BULLET_RE` captures the trace-footer `- \`input_hash\`: \`…\`` diagnostic line as a §⑥ bullet. Fix is bounded to `publisher/watchpoint_matrix.py` (bullet pre-filter + `_short_signal` hardening + all-`데이터부족` collapse note) and `briefing/prompts.py` (§⑥ structured-bullet contract so bullets populate). Reuses u64 regexes/matcher unchanged; no new confidence enum; u56 compliance untouched. **u87 escalates and subsumes DEBT-074** (resolve-by-u87 on completion).
**Stage Decision**: FD SKIP (presentation-contract refinement over the u72 renderer; no new entity/cross-module contract), NFR SKIP (no new dep/source/secret/cost; pure str→str + prompt text; AC-87.1 strengthens R13 posture). Source = FR-002/FR-004/FR-009/FR-012 + DEBT-074 + the 2026-05-26 review.
**Artifacts**: plan `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u87-watchpoint-matrix-rehabilitation-code-generation-plan.md` (Steps 1-5, AC-87.1..87.7); registered in `unit-of-work.md`, `unit-of-work-story-map.md`, `aidlc-state.md`. Docs-only — no production code changed. Candidates u88 (watchlist public-impact-line sanitization), u89 (crypto numeric formatting), u90 (meaning-line completeness), u91 (observational-tag prose leakage) derived but NOT yet registered.

## Construction — u59 macro-actual-priority-and-lineage Complete (Step 8 + Step 9 — UNIT CLOSED 9/9)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-31T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Final u59 slice landed (developer in isolated worktree, integrated to main by the lead/main session) — Step 8 orchestrator ingest/transition wire + Step 9 docs/gate. Closes the long-running u59 unit (Steps 1-7 already complete; Step 8 was model/persistence-only partial).
**Decision**: Ratify and close u59 (9/9). Step 8 pure transition `advance_macro_lifecycle(prior_events, collected_items, target_date)` added to `briefing/macro_carryover.py`: joins macro lifecycle events **strictly by `event_key`** (never substring — plan Step 8 hard rule), applies `scheduled → unresolved → confirmed → stale` with **confirmation window = release day + 1 grace day** and `follow_up_until = confirmed_date + 1 day` (one follow-up day), drops confirmed events whose `follow_up_until < target_date` unless reintroduced. Deterministic — sorts by `event_key`, takes `target_date` as a parameter (no wall clock). Orchestrator `pipeline.py` wires load→advance→`upsert_macro_lifecycle_snapshot` between `CollectStage` and `GenerateStage` as **operator-only `_meta` state** (`archive/_meta/macro_event_carryover.jsonl`); persistence failure degrades with a WARNING and never crashes the pipeline (mirrors Step 7 lineage persistence). **Bounded scope honored**: NO reader-facing carryover prose and NO LLM prompt-contract change in this slice (surfacing carryover as reader watch points is a separate future unit).
**Open questions resolved**: the genuinely-open Step 8 lifecycle/confirmation-window rule = release day + 1 grace day, 1 follow-up day (documented in the `macro_carryover.py` module docstring). Prior-resolved unit answers recorded in the summary (flat metadata bridge; PPI actual series = FRED `PPIFID`; one Stage-2 retry then fail; operator-only `_meta` staging; shared-macro trigger not widened from a single P0 actual).
**Verification**: developed in worktree (base sibling of main off `0c4f1d5`; the four u59-touched files byte-identical to main HEAD `f280647` → zero-conflict 3-way apply). Integrated to main and re-ran the FULL gate on top of u86: ruff clean, ruff-format clean (changed scope), mypy --strict clean (2 changed source files), **pytest 2855 passed** (= 2845 u86 baseline + 10 new u59 tests: 8 carryover lifecycle + 2 orchestrator wire incl. graceful-failure), mkdocs build --strict pass. AC-11 (macro carryover lifecycle persists across runs) MET.
**Status**: u59 complete (9/9). FD+NFR were SKIP-initially (source/LLM-stage correction unit). No reader-facing behavior change in the final slice.
**New TECH-DEBT registered**: DEBT-079 (calendar↔actual event-key linkage — `fred-economic-calendar` release_id=46 and `fred-macro` series PPIFID infer *different* event keys, so a schedule and its actual track as two lifecycle events; a future slice could stamp a shared canonical `macro_event_key` on both adapters); DEBT-080 (`_segment_for_item` matches by object identity against in-run routed items — correct in-process but would not survive serialization).

## Construction — u86 curated-context-asset-library Complete (new product unit, not Wave 14)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-30T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u86 Code Generation finalized + committed (`f280647`) by the main session — the working-tree implementation (Steps 1-6) was gated and closed.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u86 (6/6). Pre-curated, license-clean, committed local context-image library mapped by entity/topic (`person:`/`topic:`/`asset:`), drawn at briefing time via deterministic entity match — **no runtime scraping** (`EXTERNAL_IMAGE_SCRAPING_ENABLED` stays False; curated path never fetches). New `visuals/curated.py` (`load_library`/`select_curated_asset`/`default_registry` + deferred-asset state machine I14/I15/I16: explicit-deferred green, silent-empty red per AC-1.2). `policy.py` `curated-licensed` kind + `assert_curated_asset_allowed` (clearance without scraping; `explicit-license` runtime scraping unchanged). `provenance.py` `build_curated_provenance`. `assets.py` hero priority `external-context-image > curated-context-image > ai-market-hero > data-confidence`. `scripts/check_curated_assets.py` license-clearance CI gate (mirrors `check_no_paid_apis.py`; R13 manifest hygiene; orphan/budget/license). Entity extraction reuses u64 watchlist matcher (no new fuzzy matcher). 13 seed keys filed manifest-only/deferred — operator commits cleared binaries later with no code change.
**Verification**: FD+NFR both Required and authored 2026-05-28. Full gate green 2026-05-30: ruff/format clean, mypy --strict 15 changed files clean, `check_curated_assets.py` exit 0 (`0 filed, 13 deferred`), pytest **2845 passed**, mkdocs build --strict pass. Folds in the Stage Decision workflow convention (CLAUDE.md + dev-investo SKILL.md) that u86's plan was first to apply.
**Status**: u86 complete (6/6). No new TECH-DEBT (seed binaries deliberately deferred via the explicit-deferred state, not debt).

## Construction — u85 unified-validator-gate-protocol Complete (Wave 14, Phase 3 CAPSTONE — WAVE 14 COMPLETE)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T19:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u85 Code Generation landed (developer) — capstone validator/gate protocol, additive; full gate green. **Closes Wave 14 (u77–u85).** (Concurrent session active — additive only; u86 entries preserved.)
**Decision**: Ratify and close u85 (5/5, DESCOPED). New `_internal/validation.py` — `ValidationResult` (severity **`pass`/`warn`/`block`** only) + `Validator` protocol (read-only `name` property so frozen dataclass adapters satisfy it) + `ValidationRegistry`. **Review corrections honored in full**: `downgrade` DROPPED (no existing gate produces it), `is_blocking` DROPPED from the protocol (registry derives blocking from `block` severity), `ValidationResult` scoped as a thin gating envelope (not a payload-unifier).
**Principled descope (the wrong-abstraction STOP, exactly as the review + plan sanctioned)**: on inspection the ~16 checks are NOT all unifiable. Briefing pipeline invokes only `leak_guard.scan` in-pipeline (citation_cardinality/date_corruption/numeric_verify/accuracy are not called there; summary_quality fires at the orchestrator boundary). Publisher gates (`scan_compliance` ×2, cross_segment_lint, anchor_assertion_gate, cause_map) are interleaved between str→str markdown transforms inside `publisher/segment_reader_format.py` with load-bearing ordering (compliance runs before AND after the watchpoint-matrix render) — NOT a separable flat sequence; lifting them would reorder the mutation pipeline (a behavior change). The developer STOPPED rather than forcing a god-`ctx`, and wrapped only the genuinely-alike set: `briefing/validators.py::LeakGuardValidator` (+`build_post_validation_registry`) and `orchestrator/validators.py` publish-boundary trio (`FirstViewportSummaryValidator` raise-through `SummaryQualityError` → `DisclaimerFooterValidator` → `ShortDisclaimerValidator`, +`build_publish_boundary_registry`). This is the review's Rule-of-Three concern validated empirically — the protocol applied only where the checks are truly alike.
**Behavior preservation**: byte-identical gates/order/raises (same `BriefingGenerationError`/`SummaryQualityError`/`PublisherDisclaimerError`); every pre-existing test passes UNCHANGED except ONE mechanical edit (`test_run_pipeline.py` patches `verify_disclaimer` at its new resolution site `orchestrator.validators`). No briefing↔publisher import (protocol in `_internal/`; briefing registry imports `_internal`+briefing, orchestrator registry imports `_internal`+briefing+publisher — orchestrator is the only unit permitted those edges). pytest **2844** (+16 new), mypy --strict 193 files, ruff clean, mkdocs --strict ok.
**Status**: u85 complete (5/5). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. **🎉 Wave 14 (u77–u85) COMPLETE — all 9 units landed behavior-preserving, full gate green, pushed.**
**Wave-14 deferred TECH-DEBT (for investo-planner to register)**: (1) ARCHIVE_ROOT seam relocation to `_internal` (post-u84); (2) narrow the wide migration-tactic `__all__` re-export surfaces (reader_format / site_index / briefing.pipeline / notifier internals); (3) `watchpoint_matrix` reaching into reader_format privates → proper shared home for the structure regexes; (4) DEBT-062 path-normalization (u84-deferred); (5) DEBT-047 producer/gate reject-set unification (u79-deferred); (6) future `Ticker` value object (u79 §6); (7) `parse_json_text` sibling for the 2 `json.loads` adapters (u77); (8) extend the module-boundary test toward the broader `→ briefing` shared-vocabulary edges.

## Construction — u84 orchestrator-stage-abstraction Complete (Wave 14, Phase 3, HIGHEST RISK)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T18:40:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u84 Code Generation landed (developer) — highest-blast-radius god-module restructured into a Stage abstraction; full gate green. (Concurrent session active — additive only; u86 entries preserved.)
**Decision**: Ratify and close u84 (6/6). `orchestrator/pipeline.py` 2809→2610 lines. New `orchestrator/stages.py` (`Stage` Protocol, frozen generic `StageResult`, `PipelineContext` `@dataclass(frozen=True)` inputs-only, `StageAction`); `CollectStage`/`GenerateStage`/`PublishStage`/`NotifyStage`/`HealthTrackingStage`. `run_pipeline` is now a sequencing+routing loop. **Review corrections all honored**: exception→action map is a declarative `EXCEPTION_ROUTING: dict[type[BaseException], StageAction]` with exact-then-MRO lookup (NOT an isinstance chain); stages injected from a composition root (`build_default_stages()` via `run_pipeline(..., stages=None)`, never instantiated inline → DIP + testable); `PipelineContext` frozen/inputs-only, stage outputs flow via `StageResult.data` accumulated by the loop (CQS — no ctx mutation). `_load_*` context loaders → `orchestrator/stage_context.py`; reader-format leak → `publisher/segment_reader_format.py::apply_reader_format_to_segments` (publisher API, publisher/models vocabulary only, no `PipelineContext` across the boundary; orchestrator→publisher edge allowed).
**Behavior preservation**: **`test_run_pipeline.py` (2164 lines) UNCHANGED — `git diff` empty** = the behavior-preservation proof. pytest **2828** (+8 from new `test_stage_protocol.py`; the pure-refactor suite + integration green with zero edits). mypy --strict 190 files, ruff clean, mkdocs --strict ok. No files deleted (function clusters moved out, `pipeline.py` modified in place). Module boundary intact.
**Brittleness audit (Step 5)**: `test_run_pipeline.py` is outcome-based (`result.status`, `result.stages`, `alerter.calls`); the only implementation-coupled assertions are 3 AST-grep deny tests (no `wait_for`/`gather`/retry wrapping a bare `_stage_*` Name-call) — the new loop calls `stage.execute(...)` (attribute call), so they pass. No rewrite needed.
**DEBT-062 (path normalization) DEFERRED, not folded** — behavior-touching, must land as its own commit per contract clause 8; left out-of-scope, stays open.
**Status**: u84 complete (6/6). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next: u85 (unified Validator/Gate protocol, capstone — HARD dep on u84 now satisfied).

## Construction — u86 curated-context-asset-library FD + NFR authored
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T16:40:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u86 plan approved ("Continue to Next Stage"); user confirmed two binding policy refinements — (1) deferred-asset allowance, (2) seed a minimum of real cleared binaries. Planner authors the FD + NFR docs that pin R-numbers / AC-numbers before the developer starts Step 1. (Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only; the u80/u81 Wave-14 entries below are preserved.)
**Decision**: Authored the three per-unit FD files (**R1-R9**, entities **E1-E5**, invariants **I1-I16**) and the two NFR files (**AC-1.1-AC-1.6**, **TS-1-TS-3**). No application code, no seed binaries authored (developer owns Steps 1-6 in a separate worktree).
**Design Q/A (user-confirmed policy, binding)**:
- **Deferred-asset allowance (R8 / I14-I16, AC-1.2)**: a registered key may lack a committed binary **only** when **explicitly** declared `deferred` via a machine-checkable marker (sibling `{asset_id}.deferred` file OR `allowed_use` substring `not-yet-available`). An explicit-deferred key **passes** the strict CI gate (green); a binary-absent key with **no** marker is `(invalid)` and **fails** (red) — no silent empties. Deferred keys are never selectable (I10/I11) and never render. **Auto-verification on fill (I15)**: when the binary is later committed + marker removed, the gate re-classifies the key as `filed` and applies R2/R3/R4 + AC-1.1 with no spec/script edit.
- **Seed minimum-real-binaries (Step 5)**: ship 2-3 high-confidence seeds as actual cleared binaries (e.g. Powell official PD portrait `person:jerome-powell`, PD Bitcoin logo `asset:bitcoin`, one Unsplash Wall-Street topic) to prove end-to-end; remaining seed candidate keys registered as `deferred`.
- Runtime scraping stays disabled (`EXTERNAL_IMAGE_SCRAPING_ENABLED=False`); curated path performs zero external fetch (R4 / AC-1.5). License-clean sourcing only (R2); excluded categories hard-rejected (R3). Reuse `ExternalAssetManifest` (`curated-licensed` kind), `provenance.py` caption/manifest, `assets.py` validation gate, u64 watchlist matcher. Hero priority pinned: `external-context-image > curated-context-image > ai-market-hero > data-confidence` (R9).
**Deferred-asset state machine (E5 summary)**: `deferred` (marker + no binary → green, non-selectable) → `filed` (binary + manifest, clears R2/R3/R4 + budget → green, selectable). `(invalid)` (silent empty / no manifest / disallowed license / over-budget) → gate RED. The marker's presence is the green/red discriminator; the marker's removal is the deferred→filed transition signal.
**TS- decision**: **TS-1** no new dependency — **pillow NOT introduced**; reuse the existing `visuals/assets.py` PNG/JPEG/SVG signature + dimension parsing. **TS-2** reuse manifest + provenance types (no parallel schema; single-sourced R13 redaction). **TS-3** CI gate `scripts/check_curated_assets.py` stdlib-only, mirrors `check_no_paid_apis.py`. Net dependency delta: none.
**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u86-curated-context-asset-library/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` (new)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u86-curated-context-asset-library/functional-design/business-rules.md` (new — R1-R9)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u86-curated-context-asset-library/functional-design/domain-entities.md` (new — E1-E5, I1-I16)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u86-curated-context-asset-library/nfr-requirements/nfr-requirements.md` (new — AC-1.1-AC-1.6)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u86-curated-context-asset-library/nfr-requirements/tech-stack-decisions.md` (new — TS-1-TS-3)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u86-curated-asset-library-code-generation-plan.md` (Stage Decision note + NFR AC coverage map updated; R/AC pinned)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (Per-Unit table: u86 FD ✅ + NFR ✅; CG stays Planned 0/6)
**Status**: u86 FD + NFR complete; Code Generation Planned (0/6). Developer may start Step 1 (R-numbers / AC-numbers pinned). No application code changed.
**Context**: Project rules re-stated and enforced in the FD/NFR — module boundary (visuals stays in its layer; only orchestrator imports the 4 product units), no paid APIs, disclaimer gate unchanged (R9), Telegram channel separation untouched, R13 secret hygiene via the u27 chokepoint (R7 / AC-1.6).

## Construction — u83 briefing-pipeline-decomposition Complete (Wave 14, Phase 3, HIGH RISK)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T17:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u83 Code Generation landed (developer) — god-module decomposition; full gate green. (Concurrent session active — additive only; u86 entries preserved.)
**Decision**: Ratify and close u83 (7/7). `briefing/pipeline.py` 1924→561 lines → sub-packages: `_core/` (classification, section_planning, orchestration — Claude-CLI loop + timeout/retry budget preserved exactly), `_assembly/` (text_normalize, summary_extraction, markdown_render OUTPUT-only, prompt_fields LLM-input), `_reader_enhance/` (coverage_badge, context_render, enhancement, lineage). **Context-block rendering single-homed in `_reader_enhance/context_render.py`** (the earlier double-listing bug corrected). `pipeline.py` is a thin `generate_briefing` orchestrator + re-export block.
**Step 4b (SLAP, logic-edit explicitly permitted, review-added)**: extracted `_assemble_prompt_context`/`_append_traceability_footer`/`_finalize_briefing` — the two previously-duplicated `Briefing(...)` constructions (data-limited + main path) collapsed into ONE; `generate_briefing` body now has no raw string concat / no footer `+=` / one `Briefing(...)` call — single altitude. Proven byte-identical by the u65 replay harness.
**Step 5 (review-added)**: brittleness audit found `test_pipeline_unit.py`/`test_fake_claude_runner.py` are behavioral (assert outcomes, not call sequences) → no pre-rewrite needed; replay failure-path coverage confirmed (leak-guard trigger, budget exhaustion, classification/synthesis BGE, data-limited shortcut).
**Behavior preservation**: **pytest 2767 net delta 0** (byte-identical; the +53 in the raw run are the concurrent u86 WIP test files, not u83). Zero non-test caller edits (`orchestrator/pipeline.py` resolves `GenerationPolicy`/`generate_briefing` via re-export). 9 MECHANICAL test edits only (monkeypatch seam `call_claude_code`/`_BACKOFF_SCHEDULE` moved pipeline→`_core.orchestration`; pattern-guard pointed at `_assembly`). mypy --strict 187 files, ruff clean, mkdocs --strict ok.
**TECH-DEBT candidate**: ~230-line full re-export block in `pipeline.py` freezes the private surface as API (migration tactic) — follow-up to narrow once private-name importers (mostly tests) migrate to the new module homes.
**Status**: u83 complete (7/7). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next: u84 (orchestrator/pipeline.py Stage abstraction, HIGHEST risk).

## Construction — u82 site-index-subpackage Complete (Wave 14, Phase 2 — Phase 2 done)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T16:35:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u82 Code Generation landed (developer) — structural module→package split; full gate green. **Closes Wave 14 Phase 2 (u80/u81/u82).** (Concurrent session active — additive only; u86 entries preserved.)
**Decision**: Ratify and close u82 (4/4). `publisher/site_index.py` (681 lines, 4 independent surfaces) → `publisher/site_index/` package: `_blocks.py` (`_replace_section`/`_replace_marker_block`/`_escape_inline`/`_write_text_atomic`→delegates to u78 `write_atomic`, `_NEXT_HEADING_RE`) + `_constants.py` (paths/markers/`_SEGMENTS`) + one module per surface (`hero`/`archive_sections`/`segment_archives`/`quality_dashboard`). `update_latest_index_pages` driver in `__init__.py` (same call order) + full public re-export + `X as X` private aliases for cross-module refs. Call-time monkeypatch preserved: `update_quality_page`/`update_accuracy_page` resolve default page path via the package namespace so `conftest.py` `monkeypatch.setattr(site_index_mod, …)` still reaches them.
**Behavior preservation**: move-only; **zero caller import edits** (orchestrator + tests unchanged), **pytest 2767 — delta 0** = byte-identical pages; mkdocs --strict identical. Gate: ruff clean, mypy --strict 172 files. `quality_consistency.py` untouched; no `MarkdownBuilder` introduced; zero `os.replace` write pattern remains in the package.
**Status**: u82 complete (4/4). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. **Phase 2 (u80/u81/u82) complete.** Next: Phase 3 — u83 (briefing god-module, high risk) → u84 (orchestrator, highest risk) → u85 (capstone, HARD dep on u84), one at a time gate-green between each.

## Construction — u81 reader-format-subpackage Complete (Wave 14, Phase 2)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T16:10:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u81 Code Generation landed (developer) — pure structural module→package split; full gate green. (Concurrent session active — additive only.)
**Decision**: Ratify and close u81 (4/4). `publisher/reader_format.py` (1208 lines) → `publisher/reader_format/` package: `_constants.py` (shared markers/regex + the package logger, named `investo.publisher.reader_format` to preserve `caplog` logger-name identity) + one module per pass (`tldr`/`headings`/`emphasis`/`watchpoint_audit`/`glossary`/`meaning`/`disclaimer`/`sentence_audit`/`reflow`). `apply_reader_format` + `_split_disclaimer_footer` orchestration in `__init__.py` in the **exact verbatim** pass order (u76 step / u71 position untouched). All 26 public `__all__` names re-exported; additionally 5 PRIVATE names (`_BULLET_RE`, `_SECTION_HEADER_RE`, `_WATCHPOINT_{SOURCE,TRIGGER,IMPLICATION}_RE`) re-exported via explicit `X as X` aliases (NOT in `__all__`) because `watchpoint_matrix.py` imports them directly — preserves that path under mypy `no_implicit_reexport`.
**Behavior preservation**: every move was move-only (no logic edit); **zero caller import edits** (`git diff` over all callers clean), **zero test edits**, **pytest 2767 — delta 0** vs baseline = byte-for-byte identical output (the unchanged suite is the proof). Gate: ruff clean, mypy --strict 166 files, mkdocs --strict ok.
**TECH-DEBT candidate**: package `__all__` freezes today's full 26-name surface + 5 private re-exports as API; follow-up should narrow `__all__` and give `watchpoint_matrix` a proper shared home for the structure regexes instead of reaching into a sibling's privates (wave-wide deferred "narrow surface" debt).
**Status**: u81 complete (4/4). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next: u82 (site_index → package, dep u78 ✓).

---

## Construction — u80 notifier-decomposition-and-dispatcher-base Complete (Wave 14, Phase 2)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T15:45:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u80 Code Generation landed (developer) — behavior-preserving notifier decomposition; full gate green. (Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only; u86 planning entry below preserved.)
**Decision**: Ratify and close u80 (4/4). `notifier/summary.py` split into extraction (`_summary_extract.py` — pure structured data, no formatting/UTF-16/markdown), formatting (stays in `summary.py`, imports UTF-16 from `_internal/text.py`), and event policy (`_events.py`); `build_segmented_summary` is a thin compose, byte-identical output. **Review correction honored — composition, not an LSP base**: shared `dispatch(...)` free function in `_dispatcher.py` (single `_is_markdown_parse_error`), both clients *call* it; no common supertype, no shared/default chat id (`chat_id` is a required param → R5 structurally preserved); `dispatch` owns `parse_mode` exclusively (injecting it via `**send_kwargs` raises `TypeError`, tested). Event-detection got its own `_events.py` (distinct "what counts as imminent" change-axis), not folded into extraction.
**Behavior preservation**: all 130 pre-existing notifier tests pass UNCHANGED (no assertion modified; UTF-16 aliases kept for existing imports). Gate: ruff clean, mypy --strict 156 files, pytest **2767 passed** (+24), mkdocs --strict ok. Module boundary intact (only pre-existing `_summary_extract → briefing.market_anchor` edge, no new crossing).
**TECH-DEBT candidate**: wide internal `__all__` surfaces (`_summary_extract`/`_events`/`_dispatcher`) — migration-tactic-wide; candidate for the wave's deferred "narrow `__all__`" debt.
**Status**: u80 complete (4/4). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next: u81 (reader_format → package), u82 (site_index → package); both dep u78 ✓.

## Planning — u86 curated-context-asset-library unit created
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T15:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User requested a feature to pre-curate and pre-verify license-clean context images into a committed local asset library, mapped by entity/topic metadata, and drawn at briefing-generation time — instead of any runtime fetch.
**Decision**: Author a new **product** unit **u86** (next free id; Wave 14 occupies u77–u85). Wrote a self-contained Code Generation plan with a Stage Decision (**FD REQUIRED-lightweight + NFR REQUIRED-focused**, the only Wave-14-era unit to require both — justified by a new persisted artifact with license/storage invariants), 6 `[ ]` steps, dependency graph, NFR AC coverage map, a seed candidate list with per-source license basis, and Non-Goals. No code, no FD/NFR docs, no seed binaries authored yet (all `Planned`).
**Design Q/A (user-confirmed policy, binding)**:
- Sourcing scope = license-clean only: US-federal-government PD official portraits (Powell/President), PD crypto logos (Bitcoin), and commercially-reusable stock (Unsplash/Pexels). Clearance criterion = **republishability** to public GitHub Pages + public Telegram rebroadcast.
- Excluded: news-article photos, community memes, corporate trademark logos, unofficial photos of real people.
- **Runtime scraping stays disabled** (`EXTERNAL_IMAGE_SCRAPING_ENABLED=False`). u86 reads only from the committed, pre-cleared local library; zero external fetch on the curated path.
- Provenance/attribution caption mandatory on every used asset; disclaimer rules unchanged.
**Reuse mandate (no rebuild)**: extend `visuals/policy.py` `AllowedExternalAssetKind` with `curated-licensed` (reuse `ExternalAssetManifest`, not a parallel type); reuse `visuals/provenance.py` caption/manifest; flow through `visuals/assets.py` validation gate + `_HERO_PRIORITY`; reuse u64 `briefing/watchlist.py` matcher for entity extraction; do NOT call or re-enable `visuals/external_image.py`.
**Stage Decision rationale**: FD REQUIRED because a new persisted artifact (library + registry) carries its own invariants (clearance, entity-key mapping, deterministic selection). NFR REQUIRED because two new surfaces appear — repository/Pages **storage budget** (committed binaries) and a blocking **license-compliance CI gate** (mirrors `check_no_paid_apis` style) + R13 manifest secret hygiene. No new dependency expected (TS-: reuse existing signature/dimension parsing, no pillow).
**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u86-curated-asset-library-code-generation-plan.md` (new)
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (Per-Unit table: 1 new `Planned` row u86)
- (pending approval) `aidlc-docs/construction/u86-curated-context-asset-library/functional-design/{business-logic-model,business-rules,domain-entities}.md` + `nfr-requirements/{nfr-requirements,tech-stack-decisions}.md`
**Status**: u86 planned (0/6). Awaiting "Continue to Next Stage" before authoring FD + NFR docs (pins R-numbers / AC-numbers) and starting Step 1.
**Context**: Project rules re-stated in the plan and enforced — module boundary (only `orchestrator` imports the 4 units; visuals stays within the publisher/visuals layer per Wave-14 u78 boundary), no paid APIs, disclaimer gate, Telegram channel separation, `defusedxml`-only, R13 secret hygiene. No application code changed.

## Construction — u79 shared-text-primitives Complete (Wave 14, Phase 1 — Phase 1 done)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T14:10:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u79 Code Generation landed (developer) — behavior-preserving text-primitive relocation; full gate green. **Closes Wave 14 Phase 1 (u77/u78/u79).**
**Decision**: Ratify and close u79 (3/3). UTF-16 helpers (`utf16_units`/`utf16_truncate`/`truncate_with_suffix`/`UTF16_TRUNCATION_SUFFIX`) moved to `_internal/text.py`; `notifier/summary.py` + `operator_alerter.py` delegate (notifier UTF-16 tests kept green via aliased re-imports — no test edit). New `briefing/_text/patterns.py` centralizes ticker/markdown regexes; `pipeline.py`/`segments.py`/`citation_cardinality.py`/`summary_quality.py` import them; grep-guard test pins no redeclaration.
**Review-conditional honored**: the summary-reject dedup is **DEBT-047** (live id) — left OUT OF SCOPE because the producer returns a bool while the gate raises prefix-specific `SummaryQualityError` messages with a different reject set; unifying would change gate exception-message granularity (behavior change). Only the byte-identical `_MEANINGFUL_TEXT_RE` literal was single-sourced. Distinct crypto regexes (`\b(?:BTC|ETH|SOL)\b` vs `\b(BTC|ETH)\b`) co-located as DISTINCT named constants (`CRYPTO_TICKER`/`CRYPTO_TICKER_PAIR`), not unified — unifying would be a behavior change. DEBT-035/DEBT-060 untouched.
**Behavior preservation**: every pre-existing notifier + briefing test passes UNCHANGED. Gate: ruff clean, mypy --strict 153 files, pytest **2743 passed** (+23), mkdocs --strict ok.
**Status**: u79 complete (3/3). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. **Phase 1 (u77/u78/u79) complete.** Next: Phase 2 — u80 (notifier split, dep u79 ✓), u81/u82 (publisher splits, dep u78 ✓).

## Construction — u78 filesystem-write-and-archive-layout-primitives Complete (Wave 14, Phase 1)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T13:40:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u78 Code Generation landed (developer) — behavior-preserving IO/path primitive extraction; full gate green.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u78 (4/4). New `_internal/_io.py` (split API `write_atomic(text)`/`write_atomic_bytes(data)` — NOT a `str|bytes` union, per review §9.4/ISP; docstring states same-filesystem-only + no-fsync leak boundaries) consumed by all 8 atomic-write sites incl. the originally-omitted `visuals/og_card.py:141`+`:142`. New `_internal/archive_layout.py::ArchiveLayout` (shape derivation, root injected) — both `publisher/paths.py` and `visuals/paths.py` delegate; this **dissolved the top-level `visuals → publisher` import edge**. New enforced module-boundary test (`tests/unit/_internal/test_module_boundary.py`) asserts zero top-level sibling edges across publisher⇄visuals.
**Pragmatic seam decision (ratified)**: the *mutable* `ARCHIVE_ROOT` binding stays in `publisher.paths` (the orchestrator reads it call-time + ~30 tests monkeypatch `investo.publisher.paths.ARCHIVE_ROOT`); visuals reads the live root via a lazy in-function import (not a top-level edge). Full seam relocation to `_internal` deferred → **TECH-DEBT (depends on u84)**.
**Behavior preservation**: all pre-existing publisher/visuals tests pass unchanged except ONE mechanical edit (`test_writer.py` `os.replace` patch target moved to `investo._internal._io` since the symbol moved — allowed by contract). Gate: ruff clean, mypy --strict 151 files, pytest **2720 passed** (+24), mkdocs --strict ok.
**TECH-DEBT candidates surfaced (not yet registered)**: (1) ARCHIVE_ROOT seam relocation (post-u84); (2) pervasive `→ briefing` adapter edges (publisher/notifier/sources/visuals import briefing for shared vocabulary — full zero-sibling-edge invariant needs that vocabulary moved to models/_internal); (3) pre-existing `ruff format` drift in `briefing/summary_quality.py` + `tests/unit/visuals/test_assets.py` (present at HEAD, unrelated).
**Status**: u78 complete (4/4). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next: u79 (shared text primitives, Phase 1).

## Construction — u77 source-adapter-shared-helpers Complete (Wave 14, Phase 1)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T13:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u77 Code Generation landed (developer) — behavior-preserving `sources/`-internal helper extraction; full gate green.
**Decision**: Ratify and close u77 (5/5). New `sources/_parse.py` (`parse_json_response`, `required_str`, `parse_float(strip_commas=…)`, `parse_int`) + `sources/_fanout.py` (`gather_with_error_isolation(raise_if_all_failed=…)`); extended `_config.py` (`parse_rfc822_to_utc`/`parse_iso8601_to_utc`) and `_xml_namespaces.py` (`ATOM_NS`/`DATASERVICES_M_NS`/`DATASERVICES_D_NS`). **Review-corrected Step 3 honored**: `parse_float`/`parse_int` unify ONLY binance (`strip_commas=False`, byte-identical) + fsc_krx (`strip_commas=True`); `defillama` (`float|None`) and `krx_foreign_flows` (`int|None`) left untouched (distinct contracts) — no wrong-abstraction force-unify.
**Behavior preservation**: all 652 pre-existing `sources/` tests pass UNCHANGED (AC-77.2 proof); +32 new helper tests. Gate: ruff clean, mypy --strict 149 files clean, pytest **2696 passed**, mkdocs --strict ok, `check_no_paid_apis` exit 0. Module boundary intact (no cross-unit import); defusedxml-only preserved.
**Scope-out (TECH-DEBT candidates, not yet registered)**: 2 `json.loads(...)` adapters (`fomc_calendar` also catches `UnicodeDecodeError`; `yfinance_history` positional on pre-decoded body) left as-is → candidate `parse_json_text` sibling; `sec_edgar_8k` `<updated>` ISO block byte-identical to coingecko (ns-only here).
**Status**: u77 complete (5/5). FD+NFR SKIP confirmed. Next: u78 (filesystem write + ArchiveLayout, Phase 1).

## Planning — Wave 14 Internal Abstraction & Clean-Code Refactor (u77–u85) units created
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-28T12:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User requested a whole-codebase abstraction review and AIDLC units to refactor toward reusability / single-responsibility / extensibility / clean code, written so a context-free agent can pick any unit up and execute it.
**Decision**: Author a 9-unit refactor wave (Wave 14, u77–u85) plus a shared overview defining the **Refactor Contract** all units inherit. These are **behavior-preserving** structural refactors — no product/behavior change; the unchanged existing test suite is the prime proof. No code generated yet (all units `Planned`).
**Review basis**: 4-module fan-out abstraction review of `src/investo/` (~84k LOC incl. tests). Findings: two god-modules — `orchestrator/pipeline.py` (2775 LOC, 41 fns, imports 34 submodules) and `briefing/pipeline.py` (1918 LOC, 88 fns); large single-file modules `publisher/reader_format.py` (1208), `notifier/summary.py` (755), `publisher/site_index.py` (681); cross-module duplication of low-level primitives (atomic-write ×6, JSON-decode ×17 adapters, UTF-16 truncation, datetime→UTC ×6, numeric-parse ×4); no unifying protocol over the ~11 briefing checks + ~5 publisher gates.
**Stale findings dropped after verification**: the review's "conclusion-prefix duplicated 5×" and "redaction regex duplicated" are **already resolved** (DEBT-060 via `briefing/extract.py` chokepoint; DEBT-035 via `_internal/redaction.py`). Excluded from the wave; units explicitly forbid reopening them.
**Units created** (all FD = SKIP, NFR = SKIP — internal refactors):
- **u77** source-adapter-shared-helpers (`sources/`, low risk, no deps) — 5 duplicated patterns → shared private helpers.
- **u78** filesystem-write-and-archive-layout-primitives (`publisher/`+`visuals/`, low, no deps) — `write_atomic` + `ArchiveLayout`.
- **u79** shared-text-primitives (`_internal/`+`briefing/`, low, no deps) — UTF-16 → `_internal/text.py`; briefing regex → `briefing/_text/patterns.py`.
- **u80** notifier-decomposition-and-dispatcher-base (`notifier/`, medium, dep u79) — summary extraction/formatting split + `TelegramDispatcher` base.
- **u81** reader-format-subpackage (`publisher/`, medium, dep u78 soft) — `reader_format.py` → package, one module per pass.
- **u82** site-index-subpackage (`publisher/`, medium, dep u78) — `site_index.py` → package, one module per surface.
- **u83** briefing-pipeline-decomposition (`briefing/`, high, dep u79 soft) — `_core`/`_assembly`/`_reader_enhance`; byte-identical markdown.
- **u84** orchestrator-stage-abstraction (`orchestrator/`, highest risk, dep u81 soft) — `Stage` protocol + routing loop; reader-format leak relocated to `publisher/`.
- **u85** unified-validator-gate-protocol (`briefing/`+`publisher/`, capstone, dep u83+u84 soft) — `Validator` protocol + `ValidationResult` + registry; additive wrappers.
**Sequencing**: Phase 1 (u77/u78/u79 parallelizable foundation) → Phase 2 (u80/u81/u82 module splits) → Phase 3 (u83 → u84 → u85, one at a time, gate-green between each).
**Open TECH-DEBT to potentially close (verify live IDs first)**: `_stage_publish_segments` absolute-vs-relative path normalization → folded into u84; duplicated summary-reject regexes (`briefing/pipeline.py` vs `summary_quality.py`) → candidate for u79. No new TECH-DEBT registered at planning time.
**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/wave-14-abstraction-refactor-overview.md` (new — Refactor Contract + sequencing + dependency matrix)
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u77..u85-*-code-generation-plan.md` (9 new plan files, self-contained, with Stage Decision + `[ ]` steps + AC)
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (Per-Unit table: 9 `Planned` rows u77–u85)
**Status**: Wave 14 planned (0/9 units started). Code Generation stage remains Active. Next action: a developer/agent picks u77 (or any Phase-1 unit), reads the overview's Refactor Contract, and implements with the existing suite as the behavior-preservation gate.
**Context**: Project rules re-stated in every plan and enforced as the wave's #1 contract — no Anthropic SDK, module boundary (only `orchestrator` imports the 4 units; `models/`+`_internal/` are the shared layers), free APIs, disclaimer gate, Telegram channel separation, `defusedxml`-only, R13 secret hygiene. No application code changed in this planning step.

## Construction — u76 plain-language-reader-aids Complete (Wave 13 backlog cleared)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T27:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u76 (plain-language-reader-aids) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. **This is the last unit of the Wave 13 backlog (u69–u76)** — backlog now empty. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only, other lines preserved.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (5/5 steps). Sections §②-§⑤ now carry one short plain-Korean meaning line answering "그래서 의미는?" — a market-implication prose layer, **not** a glossary. Confirmed u76 is a **hybrid**: content is produced by the Stage-2 LLM prompt; the deterministic pass enforces placement / length / dedup / compliance only and **never invents a meaning line** (the data-limited fallback is a prompt-contract obligation, not a deterministic backfill). Confirmed u40/u68 invariant (AC-76.4): the meaning marker `> **그래서 의미는?** ` is lexically disjoint from the u40 `> **용어 가이드**` callout and u68 carryover vocabulary; `normalize_meaning_lines` regex-matches **only** the meaning marker, so glossary/carryover lines are never captured.
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/reader_format.py`** (changed): u76 meaning-line section — constants `MEANING_MARKER` / `MEANING_FALLBACK` / `MEANING_MAX_CHARS`; helpers `_bound_meaning_body` / `normalize_meaning_lines` / `_repair_section_meaning`; `apply_reader_format` chain step 4.5 (after `dedupe_glossings`, immediately before footer rejoin); `__all__` updated.
- **`src/investo/briefing/prompts.py`** (changed): `STAGE2_SYSTEM` gains a meaning-line rule block (plain-Korean relevance, banned 매매권유/목표가/결과예측, observational-only, ticker-name clarity).
- **Tests**: new `tests/unit/publisher/test_reader_format_meaning_u76.py` (14) + `tests/unit/briefing/test_prompts.py` (+1). Net delta +15.
**Contract (stable, idempotent)**: marker `> **그래서 의미는?** `; §②-§⑤ only; after the first paragraph/table block, before the next H3/H2; one line per section (dedup); marker-trailing body truncated at 80 Korean-visible chars on a word boundary; rerun replaces the existing line in the same section; data-limited fallback (LLM-owned) `> **그래서 의미는?** 현재 수집 근거가 부족해 방향보다 확인 필요 항목으로만 봅니다.`.
**Header-preservation bug found and fixed**: the initial span reassembly dropped non-§②-§⑤ `##` header text (e.g. `## Watchlist Carryover`); fixed by re-inserting the `text[cursor:start]` header slice ahead of each section span during reassembly. Glossary/carryover tests pin the invariant (lead re-confirmed glossary/carryover/prompts 71 passed).
**Compliance precedence (AC-76.5)**: the meaning pass does not paraphrase u56 P0 advice vocabulary; after `apply_reader_format` the orchestrator's existing `scan_compliance` scans the whole markdown and rejects publish via `ComplianceLanguageError` if P0 language survives in a meaning line. Pinned by `test_advice_meaning_line_rejected_by_compliance` ("매수 검토" rejected). The Stage-2 prompt also forbids 매매권유/목표가/결과예측, observational only.
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (reader-format / prompt contract refinement over existing rendered markdown; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: none (developer determination — no new dependency, no signature change, pure `str → str` plus prompt text). Not registered.
**Risk recorded**: meaning-line *content* quality is LLM-dependent — the deterministic pass enforces placement/length/dedup/compliance only. A future deterministic evidence-threshold enforcement of line content would be a separate unit.
**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u76-plain-language-reader-aids/code/summary.md` (new — Scope/Stage Decision(FD+NFR SKIP)/hybrid generation+validation/u40+u68 invariant(AC-76.4)/meaning-line contract/header-preservation bug fix/compliance precedence(AC-76.5)/AC-76.1-5 traceability/FD divergences/TECH-DEBT(none)/risk/gate)

**Status**: u76 complete (5/5). AC-76.1..AC-76.5 MET. Gate: ruff clean / ruff-format clean / mypy --strict 144 files clean / pytest 2641 passed / mkdocs build --strict pass. FD SKIP and NFR SKIP confirmed at closeout. **Wave 13 backlog (u69–u76) fully cleared.**
**Context**: Project rules upheld — 무료 API only (no external call; deterministic `str → str` + prompt text), Anthropic SDK 금지 (untouched — content via Stage-2 Claude Code CLI prompt), 모듈 경계 (`reader_format` publisher-internal; prompt rule briefing-internal; orchestrator-only cross-unit import preserved), 면책조항 (footer untouched — meaning pass runs before footer rejoin) + 채널 분리 gates untouched, R13 no secret (no secret surface touched), `defusedxml` not invoked. No new data source / numeric-verification rule / dependency.

## Construction — u75 chart-data-externalization-and-mobile-performance Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T26:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u75 (chart-data-externalization-and-mobile-performance) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (asset-packaging refactor, no entity); `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only, other lines preserved.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (5/5 steps). Heavy inline OHLC history JSON (`data-history`) is removed from segment markdown/HTML and externalized to deterministic archive-local sidecar JSON files; expanded charts lazy-fetch the sidecar only on explicit expand. Compact cards render ticker/price/change with no history fetch and no viewport prefetch. Confirmed u75 **extends u50, it does not redesign the chart**: the bundled lightweight-charts, expanded candlestick, ATH/52w price-line overlays, dark/light `MutationObserver` theme, and the compact `details`/`summary` + `data-close`/`data-pct` card UI are all unchanged; the u70 `data-label` registry (`^IXIC`→"나스닥 종합") is preserved. Only the data source for the expanded history moved from inline to sidecar.
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/chart_sidecar.py`** (new): sidecar contract. `chart_id`=`{segment}-{normalized_ticker}` (non-`[a-z0-9]` runs→`-`, lowercased); path `{segment_archive_stem}.assets/charts/{chart_id}.json` (relative to segment markdown). `to_json_bytes()` = `schema_version` 1, stable key order, compact separators, Decimal-as-string, `history` ascending by date, `provenance.run_date`=target date (no wall clock → byte-deterministic). `write_chart_sidecar()` atomic (tmp + `os.replace`) + idempotent.
- **`src/investo/publisher/charts.py`** (changed): `build_chart_artifacts()`→`ChartArtifacts(block, sidecars)`; `render_chart_placeholder` emits `data-history-src` instead of inline `data-history`; `_serialize_history`/`_data_history_attr` removed; duplicate `chart_id` disambiguated with `-{ordinal}` in source order.
- **`site_docs/assets/investo-chart-init.js`** (changed): compact cards render from summary attrs only (no inline history, no prefetch sparkline); `loadSidecarBars(src)` lazy-fetches inside the toggle handler only (no viewport prefetch); per-card Korean loading/error state; dead sparkline/`safeParse` removed.
- **`src/investo/publisher/briefing_replay.py`** (changed): `_check_chart_sidecars` reports `chart-sidecar-missing` **warning** when `data-history-src` is unresolved — compact card still renders (graceful degradation, not a publish block).
- **`src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`** (changed): `_inject_chart_blocks_into_segments` takes `target_date`, writes sidecars, returns `(briefings, sidecar_paths)`; call site merges sidecar paths into `visual_asset_paths` so they are snapshotted/staged/committed with the segment markdown.
- **Tests**: new `tests/unit/publisher/test_chart_sidecar.py`; updated `test_chart_placeholder.py`/`test_chart_assets.py`/`test_briefing_replay.py`/`test_run_pipeline.py`.
**Payload reduction (252-row AAPL fixture)**: per-card inline `div` ~102 B (was 7–15 KB with inline `data-history`); one-card block 575 B; ~18 KB history moved to the lazily-fetched sidecar.
**Lazy-load design**: no sidecar fetch on render, no viewport prefetch in v1; `loadSidecarBars` runs only on explicit click/keyboard expand; failed fetch shows a per-card Korean error state and does not break sibling cards; theme + ATH/52w overlays unchanged on expand.
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (asset-packaging/client-loading refactor over existing u50 chart artifacts; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: **DEBT-077** (Low) — pre-existing committed `archive/` briefings still carry the old inline `data-history`; with no sidecar they are now non-expandable (JS hides a `details` whose `data-history-src` is absent). Backfill out of scope; additive fix = a one-shot regeneration/migration pass emitting sidecars for historical archive charts. **DEBT-078** (Low) — the compact-card pre-fetch sparkline was removed (it required inline history); re-introducing a tiny `data-spark` polyline is a product decision, currently unimplemented.
**Risk recorded**: legacy archive non-expandable (DEBT-077) — compact summary still renders, new briefings unaffected. Compact sparkline removed (DEBT-078) — cards still show ticker/price/change.
**Affected docs**:

## Construction — u74 market-channel-depth-v2 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T26:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u74 (market-channel-depth-v2) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only, other lines preserved.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (5/5 steps). Every segment now exposes a deterministic native anchor block; unavailable native rows render explicit reason rows (no silent omission, no invented values); cross-market explanation is double-gated through u57. Confirmed u74 **consumes u66/u67, it does not re-implement them**: the channel anchor block reads the reconciled `MarketAnchor` set already passed into each segment (same `anchors` the top table swap uses) for domestic (u67) — no precedence change, no new domestic adapter — and reads the existing u66 `indicator` raw_metadata contract (`global_market`/`fear_greed`/`btc_funding`/`btc_oi`) for crypto — no new crypto source; u66-unlanded indicators (liquidation leg) render `아직 미제공`. The fear/greed cell is value-only — the `(분류)` gloss stays owned by u66 `## ⓪-A` (dedupe-collision avoidance).
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/channel_anchor_block.py`** (new): channel anchor schema + deterministic renderer; `MissingReason` enum (`source_empty`/`market_closed`/`not_collected`/`insufficient_items`/`stale`/`not_yet_available`). All-missing → empty result (caller omits — no noise grid); missing rows render a reason label only (no number, no numeric-success increment).
- **`src/investo/publisher/cross_market_cause_map.py`** (new): compact observational cause-map line.
- **`src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`** (changed): imports both modules; injection inside `_apply_reader_format_to_segments`.
- **Tests**: new `tests/unit/publisher/test_channel_anchor_block.py` + `tests/unit/publisher/test_cross_market_cause_map.py`.
**Schema**: domestic `kospi`/`kosdaq`/`usd_krw`/`sector` ← u67; us `sp500`/`nasdaq`/`dow` (+macro/yield optional) ← u49/u55; crypto `btc`/`eth` price 24h + `dominance`/`fear_greed`/`funding_oi` ← u66/u49 (liquidation → `not_yet_available`). Index/FX labels resolve through the u70 `anchor_label` registry.
**Cause-map scope safety**: double gate — u57 `BundleContext.shared_macro_block` (only keys hit by ≥2 segments) AND `cross_market_core_allowed`. Does not read tickers. Allowed types `geopolitical_oil_macro`/`fed_policy_event`/`global_systemic_risk` (last is dormant — no detector emits it today, plan-aware). Forbidden types are suppressed + logged/replay-reported, never demoted into public prose. `cross_segment_lint` byte-unchanged (29/29 pass). Observational wording only ("연결 고리"/"관찰", no prediction).
**Idempotency**: renders only when ≥1 native value present (avoids all-missing macro assertion); fear/greed value-only avoids gloss-dedupe collision with u66 `## ⓪-A`.
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (presentation/renderer over existing u66/u67/u49/u55/u57 models; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: **DEBT-076** (Low) — `BundleContext` exposes only the *rendered* shared-macro string, so `cross_market_cause_map` re-derives the cause-map type by matching Korean macro labels (`국제 유가`/`FOMC 일정`/`미 국채 수익률`) — label-coupling. Additive fix = add a structured `detected_macro_keys` field to `BundleContext` (model change — planner/scope-gated) and key the cause-map off it.
**Risk recorded**: label-coupling (DEBT-076) is maintenance brittleness, not a public misfire — forbidden links are still suppressed by the double gate. `global_systemic_risk` cause-map type is dormant (no emitting detector; plan-aware). 2 integration tests regressed during wiring, root-caused, then passing.

## Construction — u73 watchlist-impact-center-v2 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T25:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u73 (watchlist-impact-center-v2) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only, other lines preserved.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (5/5 steps). Watchlist hits now group into Direct / Related / Uncertain / Rejected; only high-confidence Direct/Related surface in the briefing body and Telegram, and Uncertain/Rejected appear only inside a collapsed R13-redacted diagnostics block on the static watchlist daily page. Confirmed u73 is a **u64 extension, not a replacement**: it consumes u64 `WatchlistMatch.confidence`/`reason`/`matched_alias` as-is, only routes accepted matches into buckets, and runs a **separate** near-miss scan for Rejected (accepted keys excluded first) — the matcher `briefing/watchlist.py` is unchanged (u64 already rejects SOL/BTC near-misses; u73 visualizes those rejections).
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/briefing/watchlist_impact.py`** (new): `build_impact_center` (group routing over u64 matches) + `public_impact` (Direct/Related projection); `_detect_rejected` near-miss scan; deterministic ordering; Rejected 25-item cap.
- **`src/investo/publisher/watchlist_pages.py`** (changed): `render_daily_impact_page` / `write_daily_impact_page` -> `site_docs/watchlist/daily.md`; index gains a group-semantics guide and links to daily; per-term table excludes `daily.md`.
- **`src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py`** (changed): body consumes `public_impact(build_impact_center(...))` — only Direct/Related reach the body.
- **`src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`** (changed): on publish writes `site_docs/watchlist/daily.md` + per-segment backlink.
- **Tests**: new `tests/unit/briefing/test_watchlist_impact.py` (22) + `tests/unit/publisher/test_watchlist_daily_page.py` (8). Net delta +30.
**Group schema (stable, deterministic)**: priority Direct > Related > Uncertain > Rejected (explicit u64 rejection always wins over text-only). Direct = u64 `structured`, or ticker/asset `strict`/`alias`. Related = `text` with long/non-ASCII sector/keyword evidence. Uncertain = short `text`, or `text` against a ticker/asset term. Rejected = configured short ASCII ticker (<=4 chars) + near-miss token (shared-prefix family or uppercase ticker-shaped lookalike, +-2 length, same first letter) that u64 did NOT accept. BTC<->BTM/BTCS, SOL<->SLGL, "Solana Inc" (no alias) all land Rejected/non-Direct; Bitcoin/BTC-USD/Solana/SOL-USD aliases stay Direct.
**Public / diagnostic boundary (R13 redaction)**: Direct/Related only -> daily page (with titles) + briefing body + Telegram. Uncertain/Rejected only inside a collapsed `<details><summary>진단: 보류/제외된 후보</summary>` block on the daily page with titles redacted to source name + reason code + offending token + 6-char title hash — title/summary/URL never exposed. Telegram non-leakage pinned by test: `public_impact` projects diagnostics out before the Telegram surface.
**Module boundary**: `watchlist_impact` briefing-internal over u64 matches; `watchlist_pages` publisher-internal over prepared impact data; orchestrator wires daily-page write + backlink. No briefing<->publisher<->notifier cross-import — orchestrator-only cross-unit import rule upheld. u56 observational-only contract untouched (AC-73.5).
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (classification/presentation over existing u64 match models; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: **DEBT-075** (Low) — the Rejected uppercase ticker-shaped lookalike heuristic is intentionally broad and can list an unrelated uppercase ticker that shares a configured short ticker's first letter; diagnostics-only / non-public (R13-redacted), so operator-trust noise rather than a reader error. Additive fix = tighten with a known-symbol allowlist / edit-distance bound.
**Risk recorded**: near-miss heuristic breadth (partly filtered by +-2 length window) can add operator-trust noise to the collapsed diagnostics block; never reader-facing. Tracked as DEBT-075.

## Construction — u72 watchpoint-action-matrix Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T25:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u72 (watchpoint-action-matrix) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only, other lines preserved.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (6/6 steps). §⑥ "오늘의 관전 포인트" now renders as a bounded observational monitoring matrix. Confirmed u72 is a **u64 extension, not a replacement**: it reuses u64's `check_watchpoint_actionability` + the three structure regexes (`_WATCHPOINT_SOURCE_RE`/`_TRIGGER_RE`/`_IMPLICATION_RE`) via `_is_structured` as the **single** validation contract — no second source/trigger/threshold/implication validator created (AC-72.2/plan dedup). The watchlist matcher (`briefing/watchlist.py`) is unchanged.
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/watchpoint_matrix.py`** (new): matrix schema + deterministic renderer/validator `render_watchpoint_matrix`; `_clauses` + keyword-bucket clause-slotting populates trigger columns where feasible; `_is_structured` reuses the u64 contract.
- **`src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`** (changed): `render_watchpoint_matrix` wired into the per-segment publish chain — runs **after** the first `scan_compliance`, then a **second** `scan_compliance` runs over the rendered matrix.
- **`src/investo/briefing/prompts.py`** (changed): §⑥ matrix contract as a Stage-2 rule (observational templates + banned advice vocabulary `매수/매도/비중 확대/목표가/손절/진입/청산` + source-backed-threshold requirement).
- **Tests**: new `tests/unit/publisher/test_watchpoint_matrix.py` (17) + `tests/unit/notifier/test_summary.py` (+1). Net delta +18.
**Matrix schema (stable, idempotent)**: 6 columns `관찰 신호 | 현재 | 상방 확인 조건 | 하방 확인 조건 | 신뢰도 | 섹션 내 관심 영향`; `MAX_VISIBLE_ROWS=6` + overflow note. 신뢰도 closed set `{높음, 보통, 낮음, 데이터부족}` (verified numeric→높음 / source-backed no-numeric→보통 / carryover-only→낮음 / coverage-limited·non-structured→데이터부족). Compact MD table, in-cell pipe escape, idempotent (header-presence guard), §⑥-body-local (other sections + disclaimer byte-preserved). Evidence precedence: u55 anchor → 현재/numeric trigger; u64 reason → 관찰 신호/rationale; u52 carryover → prior context only (cannot mint a trigger); otherwise one `데이터부족` row.
**Double compliance scan (u56 invariant)**: matrix conversion runs **after** the first `scan_compliance` so raw bullets are scanned as prose before a table cell can mask the P0 gate; a second `scan_compliance` runs over the rendered matrix. Cells copy LLM bullet text only — observational-only, no buy/sell/목표가 introduced. `verify_disclaimer` and the numeric verifier unchanged.
**Module boundary**: `watchpoint_matrix` is publisher-internal over prepared markdown; orchestrator wires it. §⑥ prompt rule is briefing-internal. No briefing/notifier import added — orchestrator-only cross-unit import rule upheld.
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (presentation/validation contract over existing u55/u52/u64 models; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: **DEBT-074** (clause-slotting heuristic is regex/keyword-bucket based and can under-populate trigger columns on non-standard bullets; degrades gracefully to a `데이터부족` row, not a misfire; suggested additive fix = plumb typed evidence u55 CoreFact / u52 carryover / u64 WatchlistImpact directly into the matrix builder, Low).
**Risk recorded**: clause-slotting under-population is a graceful-degrade (`데이터부족`), never an invented trigger or compliance misfire — reader-trust and observational-only contract preserved. Tracked as DEBT-074.

## Construction — u71 reader-first-viewport-reflow Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T24:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u71 (reader-first-viewport-reflow) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + DESIGN.md + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (5/5 steps). The segment first viewport now reflows into a fixed reader-first order (summary before diagnostics) with a compact status chip and collapsed `수집/품질 진단` block. Confirmed u71 is **not** a new summary-quality gate — it runs after the u51/u61/u54/u62 chain and only reorders/truncates already-validated values (AC-71.5).
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/reader_format.py`** (changed): new `reflow_first_viewport` + helpers `bound_summary_snippet` / `_compact_status_chip` / `_extract_badge_lines` / `_bound_caution_line` / `_insert_after_summary_callouts`; constants `DIAGNOSTICS_SUMMARY_LABEL` / `SNIPPET_MAX_CHARS`; `__all__` export.
- **`src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`** (changed): `reflow_first_viewport` wired into the per-segment post-format chain immediately after `emit_first_viewport_disclaimer`.
- **Tests**: new `tests/unit/publisher/test_reader_format_reflow_u71.py` (15 tests — ordering, long-diagnostics collapse, malformed/long caution fallback, status chip fields, idempotency, disclaimer preservation).
**First-viewport reflow contract (stable, idempotent)**: 1 title+watermark+nav -> 2 `## 한눈에 보기` TL;DR -> 3 summary callouts (`오늘의 결론`/`핵심 동인`/`주의할 점`, caution <=90 chars word-boundary truncation) -> 4 compact 1-line status chip `> **데이터 상태**: {label} · 본문 사용 {n|미집계} · 실패 {n} · 0건 {n}` -> 5 collapsed `<details><summary>수집/품질 진단</summary>...raw badge body...</details>` -> 6 `## ①` body. `<details open>` only when status `실패` or u61 produced no usable summary. Idempotency guard = `수집/품질 진단` summary presence. Disclaimer footer fixed (reflow touches header only). Compact chip is NOT raw diagnostics.
**Non-overlap (deduplication)**: u51 (TL;DR/H3/number-bold/dedupe), u61 (malformed-summary validation/repair), u54/u62 (status values) all retained and consumed as-is; u71 adds no parallel validator and delegates malformed values back to the u61 fallback.
**Module boundary**: `reflow_first_viewport` is publisher-internal over prepared markdown; orchestrator wires it. No briefing/notifier import added — orchestrator-only cross-unit import rule upheld.
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (presentation contract over existing summary/status values; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: none. The mobile manual-render gap is anticipated by plan Step 4 and is structurally non-overlapping with no CSS change — tracked as a summary risk, not a debt item.
**Risk recorded**: plan Step 4 390x844 / 1280x720 visual render check not executed (no Browser/Playwright). Mitigation: no CSS added; single-column document-order + Material-native `<details>` makes overlap structurally impossible. Manual mobile spot-check on the next generated briefing recommended. Smart-quote boundary glyphs (RUF001) excluded from the truncation boundary set.

## Construction — u70 cross-surface-numeric-anchor-reconciliation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T23:59:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u70 (cross-surface-numeric-anchor-reconciliation) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + state/audit + Step close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (6/6 steps). One reconciled anchor payload now feeds every reader surface; precise body move-claims are gated on anchor availability. Confirmed P1-2 extension (not replacement): the existing `_reconcile_anchor_closes` single-close reconciler is retained — no second reconciler created. No new data provider or numeric-verification rule (AC-70.5).
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/anchor_assertion_gate.py`** (new): `gate_body_assertions` / `enforce_anchor_assertions` / `NumericAnchorReconciliationError`. Blocked claim = core label + movement verb (급등/급락/상승/하락/반등/폭락/폭등/강세/약세) + explicit magnitude (%/포인트/원/달러/$) when the matching anchor is absent. Isolated sentence -> idempotent data-limited callout; interleaved/structural -> `NumericAnchorReconciliationError` (-> FAILED + alert).
- **P1-2 extension (root-cause fix)**: chart injection moved from the **un-reconciled** `market_anchors_by_segment` onto the **same reconciled** `anchor_table_input` the table consumes (was the chart-vs-table divergence root cause). `orchestrator/pipeline.py` computes the reconciled per-segment `MarketAnchor` tuples once and supplies table + compact card + expanded metadata + body gate.
- **Label registry**: `briefing/market_anchor.py` canonical `AnchorLabel` registry + `anchor_label()`; `^IXIC` -> 나스닥 종합 / "Nasdaq" (Nasdaq Composite); `^NDX` -> 나스닥 100 as a distinct symbol/label. `notifier/summary.py` Telegram snapshot label routed through the registry (fixes the hard-coded `^IXIC`->"NDX" mislabel). `publisher/charts.py` compact card + `site_docs/assets/investo-chart-init.js` render `data-label`.
- **Replay parity**: `publisher/briefing_replay.py` adds `anchor-close-divergence` and `anchor-ixic-mislabel` cross-surface findings.
- **Tests**: `test_anchor_assertion_gate.py`, `test_anchor_label.py`, `test_chart_placeholder.py` (`^IXIC` label), `test_briefing_replay.py` (close-divergence / ixic-mislabel / surfaces-agree).
**Single anchor payload contract**: reconciled per-segment `MarketAnchor` tuple (`anchor_table_input`) is the canonical source for table + compact card + expanded metadata + body gate. Label = `anchor_label(symbol)`. Missing/stale = absence from the payload (gate-enforced). `data-close` formatting unchanged; only `data-label` added.
**Module boundary**: `anchor_assertion_gate.py` is publisher-internal and consumes prepared display anchors only (no `briefing.numeric_verify` / `briefing.freshness` import). Orchestrator assembles the prepared anchors; publisher surfaces consume prepared data only — orchestrator-only cross-unit import rule upheld.
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (producer-consumer wiring over existing `MarketAnchor` / core-fact models; no new entity).
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: none — no new debt candidate surfaced.
**Risk recorded**: the body-assertion gate's move-verb/magnitude heuristic is conservative — it requires an explicit signed percent/point/price, so ambiguous claims with no numeric magnitude (e.g. "코스피 큰 폭 급락" with no figure) are not gated. Matches the plan's Step 4 definition ("precise signed percent/point/price"); broader rhetorical-claim detection is intentionally out of scope.

## Construction — u69 quality-public-consistency-gate Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T23:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u69 (quality-public-consistency-gate) Code Generation landed — code/tests/wiring/gate all green (developer). FD = SKIP (no entity); `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit + Step 5 close deferred to planner per module-boundary rule. Concurrent session active — aidlc-docs additive only.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (5/5 steps). One canonical quality snapshot per date now drives every public surface; contradictions fail deterministically at the publish boundary (blocking) and at u65 replay (read-only). No new severity enum / KPI family / external source introduced — u69 wraps u54/u62/u65 (AC-69.5).
**Delivered**:
- **`src/investo/publisher/quality_consistency.py`** (new canonical validator): `build_canonical_snapshot` / `check_quality_consistency` / `validate_date_quality_consistency` / `reconcile_kpis_with_history`. Stable codes `quality.status_mismatch`, `quality.failed_count_mismatch`, `quality.denominator_unknown_but_evidence_present`, `quality.quality_page_missing` (recorded as **skip**, never pass/fail).
- **Canonical snapshot = 1 per date**: worst-status = segment markdown `**데이터 상태**` combined with `quality_history.jsonl.worst_severity` (u54 worst-wins; no severity re-definition); has-failed-evidence = segment markdown `실패 N>0` OR history `total_failed_sources>0`. All public surfaces (quality.md / history row / segment block / index label / replay) validated against this single snapshot.
- **Wiring** (read/validate only): `briefing_replay.py` (u65 harness gets the validator + `quality_page_path: Path | None`; skip->warn, contradiction->error; archive read-only); `site_index.py` (`update_quality_page` calls `reconcile_kpis_with_history` so empty/lagging `coverage.jsonl` cannot render `실패 누적=0`); `orchestrator/pipeline.py` (`_enforce_quality_consistency_gate` + `QualityConsistencyError` at the publish boundary after quality/index render, before commit; added to the rollback `except`).
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/publisher/test_quality_consistency.py`, `test_briefing_replay.py`, `test_quality_page.py`.
**Module boundary**: `quality_consistency.py` imports only `briefing.segments` (`MarketSegment`/`CoverageStatus`/labels) — same precedent as `site_index`/`briefing_replay`; `QualityKPIs` under `TYPE_CHECKING`. Not a violation (publisher-internal; orchestrator-only cross-unit rule upheld).
**FD divergences ratified**: none — FD = SKIP (rendering/validation contract over existing models; no new entity).
**Measured 2026-05-22 finding (unmodified — out of scope)**: new replay against the live archive flags 2026-05-22 with `quality.denominator_unknown_but_evidence_present` — committed `site_docs/quality.md` renders failed count `0`/`n-a` while the bundle holds failure evidence. Render-path fix corrects future publishes; the already-committed stale page is **not** backfilled (historical archive repair is a plan Non-Goal) -> **DEBT-073**.
**Scope-out -> TECH-DEBT**: **DEBT-073** (backfill stale `site_docs/quality.md` + empty `coverage.jsonl` pre-fix rows + optional operator dashboard-interpretation runbook, Low).
**Risk recorded**: the publish-boundary gate is now **blocking** — a genuine contradiction aborts publish before commit (intended). Operators must watch for `QualityConsistencyError`; false-aborts avoided because missing `quality.md` is recorded as skip.

## Construction — u66 crypto-channel-depth Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T22:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u66 (crypto-channel-depth) Code Generation landed — code/tests/fixtures/gate all green (developer). FD edit + `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit deferred to planner per module-boundary rule.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (9/9 steps; Step 9 FD/closeout the last to land). Four no-key crypto indicator adapters delivered, the u74 raw_metadata contract pinned, and the crypto UTC-24h render frame replaces equity close language — all crypto-scoped.
**Delivered**:
- **4 new no-key adapters** (all `category="macro"` + `indicator` raw_metadata tag, crypto-routed via `_CRYPTO_ONLY_SOURCES`; **no new `Category` enum value**): `alternative-fng` (공포·탐욕, Alternative.me `/fng`), `coingecko-global-market` (BTC 도미넌스 + 전체 시총, CoinGecko `/global`), `bybit-derivatives` (BTC 펀딩비 + OI, primary), `okx-derivatives` (fallback).
- **Funding/OI precedence**: Bybit primary → OKX fallback (both no-key, geo-safe). Binance fapi NOT primary (GHA IP 451 geo-block; crypto archive shows `binance-crypto-market` 451). 공포탐욕 = Alternative.me single; 도미넌스 = CoinGecko `/global` single.
- **Render**: `briefing/crypto_indicators.py` (pure renderer) + `publisher/crypto_indicators.py` (injection). 8-row crypto indicator block (공포탐욕/도미넌스/시총/24h변동/펀딩/OI/DeFi TVL/스테이블); 청산·netflow render as explicit `무료 검증 소스 미확정` unavailable rows. Crypto anchor table/card/prompt moved from `종가` → UTC 24h frame (crypto segment only; equity segments unchanged).
- **u74 interface contract (as implemented)**: `fear_greed` (`value` 0-100, `classification`), `global_market` (`btc_dominance_pct` %, `total_market_cap_usd`, `market_cap_change_24h_pct`), `btc_funding` (`btc_funding_rate`, `funding_source` ∈ {bybit,okx}), `btc_oi` (`btc_oi_usd`, `oi_source`); liquidation leg absent. No `core_fact:*` mapping (non-core context, `warn` per u55). `coingecko-price` (BTC/ETH 24h price) unchanged.
**FD divergences ratified**: none material — the lead live probe scope was implemented as planned. Bybit confirmed no-key/geo-safe as primary (the concurrent-draft "defer all derivatives" path was correctly rejected at plan time). The two scope-outs (청산/netflow) are designed, not divergences.
**Scope-out → TECH-DEBT**: **DEBT-071** (24h 청산 — Coinglass key-required, no no-key aggregate source, Low) and **DEBT-072** (거래소 netflow — CryptoQuant/Glassnode paid, Low). Both render explicit unavailable rows; never fabricated (R10 / R16d).
**Risk recorded**: Bybit/OKX as funding/OI primary confirmed in sandbox but **not yet observed on the live GHA IP** — if both geo-block on the GHA path the indicator rows degrade to `수집 안 됨` (crypto coverage NOT downgraded — by design). First-run GHA observation recommended.

## Construction — u66 crypto-channel-depth Plan Authored + Reachability Probe Recorded
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T20:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Planner asked to author the formal u66 (crypto-channel-depth) Code Generation plan from the backlog entry, narrowing scope to the lead's confirmed live reachability probe. u74 market-channel-depth-v2 is implementation-blocked on u66 defining the crypto indicator output interface.
**Lead live reachability probe (2026-05-24, confirmed) — pinned into the plan**:
- 공포·탐욕 지수: Alternative.me `/fng/?limit=1` — ✅ 200, no-key (`value` / `value_classification`).
- BTC 도미넌스 / 전체 시총: CoinGecko `/api/v3/global` — ✅ 200, no-key (`data.market_cap_percentage.btc`).
- BTC 펀딩비 + OI: Bybit v5 `/v5/market/tickers?category=linear&symbol=BTCUSDT` — ✅ 200, no-key, **no geo-block** (primary); OKX `/api/v5/public/funding-rate` + `/open-interest` — ✅ 200, no-key (fallback).
- Binance fapi: sandbox 200 but **GHA IP 451 geo-block** (crypto archive shows `binance-crypto-market` status 451) → NOT primary; optional last resort only.
- 24h 청산 (Coinglass): ❌ `{"code":"30001","msg":"API key missing"}` — no no-key source. 거래소 netflow (CryptoQuant/Glassnode): ❌ paid/key. → both scope-out → TECH-DEBT.
**Decision**:
- In scope (no-key free confirmed): (a) 공포·탐욕, (b) BTC 도미넌스, (c) BTC 펀딩비, (d) BTC OI, (e) crypto UTC-24h render/prompt frame (replaces `종가` column + `② 전일 핵심 이슈` wording, crypto segment only).
- Source precedence: 펀딩비/OI = Bybit primary → OKX fallback (both no-key, geo-safe); Binance not primary. 공포탐욕 = Alternative.me single; 도미넌스 = CoinGecko `/global` single.
- **No new `Category` enum value** — indicators use `category="macro"` + `indicator` raw_metadata disambiguator tag, routed crypto-only via `_CRYPTO_ONLY_SOURCES`. Adding a crypto enum value would ripple through routing/prompts/coverage/fixtures; raw_metadata tagging is the lower-blast-radius choice.
- Out of scope: 24h 청산 + 거래소 netflow (no no-key source) — registered as TECH-DEBT at closeout (next free ids, expected DEBT-071 liquidation / DEBT-072 netflow). u74 renders the absent liquidation as `not_yet_available`; values are never fabricated.
**u74 interface contract fixed**: `fear_greed` (`value`/`classification`), `btc_dominance` (`btc_dominance_pct`, %), `funding_oi_liquidation` funding (`btc_funding_rate` + `funding_source` ∈ bybit/okx) + OI (`btc_oi_usd` + `oi_source`) + liquidation (absent). `btc_price_24h`/`eth_price_24h` stay on the existing `coingecko-price` adapter (unchanged). None map to a `CoreFact`, so no `core_fact:*` keys (non-core context, `warn` per u55).
**Concurrent-draft reconciliation**: a concurrent session drafted a conservative u66 plan that deferred ALL derivatives (funding/OI/청산/netflow) as "무료 검증 소스 미확정". That contradicts the lead live probe (funding/OI confirmed no-key/geo-safe). The planner consolidated to the lead-authoritative scope: funding/OI IN scope (Bybit→OKX, new Step 3b + adapter), only 청산/netflow scoped out. Stage Decision and DoD kept from the concurrent draft where consistent.
**Stage Decision**: FD REQUIRED (lightweight — new adapters incl. Bybit→OKX precedence algorithm + new crypto business rules; reuses `NormalizedItem`, no new entities, `Category` enum unchanged): u1-sources FD L6.13 `alternative-fng` / L6.14 `coingecko-global-market` / L6.15 `bybit-derivatives` (+OKX) and R16 crypto indicator contract + UTC-24h frame. NFR SKIPPED (all no-key free-tier reused under existing UTC window/retry budget; no new library; no XML so `defusedxml` not invoked; cost 0) — consistent with u67 precedent.
**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u66-crypto-channel-depth-code-generation-plan.md` (authored/consolidated — full formal plan: problem, u74 contract table, reachability, Stage Decision, Steps 1-9 incl. 3b, AC-1..8, dependency graph, How to Approve)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/unit-of-work.md` (u66 entry updated: funding/OI in-scope, 청산/netflow scope-out, u74 contract dependency)
**Status**: u66 plan awaiting approval (Request Changes / Continue to Next Stage). No code written. TECH-DEBT for 청산/netflow registered at unit closeout, not now. u74 remains blocked until u66 lands (its interface is now defined here).
**Context**: Project rules carried into the plan — 무료 API only (no-key Alternative.me/CoinGecko/Bybit/OKX; no paid 청산/netflow), Anthropic SDK 금지 (claude_code.py only), 모듈 경계 (orchestrator-only cross-unit import; adapters import only models), 면책조항 + 채널 분리 untouched, R13 no secret (all no-key sources), R10 four-path fixtures per new source.

## Construction — u68 reader-aids-residual Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T18:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u68 (reader-aids-residual) Code Generation landed — code/tests/gate all green (developer). FD edit + `code/summary.md` + TECH-DEBT + state/audit deferred to planner per module-boundary rule.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (3/3 steps). Confirm-then-extend audit (DoD #1) confirmed Gaps C/D are ~95% already delivered — C by u64 (watchpoint actionability), D glossary-position by u40 (header callout), D carryover echo by u52 — so u68 fixes only the **one genuine residual**: the glossary callout re-announced the same terms (ETF/EPS/VIX/CPI) every day because `audit_glossary_compliance` had no cross-day memory, making its "처음 등장한" claim false on day 2+.
**Confirm-then-extend basis (C/D already implemented)**:
- C watchpoint actionability — u64 (template + actionability validator); out of scope, no work.
- D header glossary callout — u40 `render_glossary_callout` wired above 오늘의 결론; fully wired.
- D carryover §⑥→§② echo — u52 `load_carryover` + `inject_carryover_block` + CARRY-1/CARRY-2; fully implemented.
- D inline first-use glossing — optional, not implemented; deferred to DEBT-070.
**Implementation**: `collect_recently_glossed(archive_root, segment, today, *, lookback=3)` reuses the u52 carryover archive-walk (weekend-skip, ≤3 loaded trading days / ≤21 calendar-day cap) to suppress terms already glossed (immediate Korean paren gloss OR prior `> **용어 가이드**` line) in the same segment's recent archives. `audit_glossary_compliance` gained `already_glossed: set[str] | None = None` (default → byte-equal prior output). `briefing/pipeline.py` takes optional `archive_root`; `orchestrator/pipeline.py` injects `archive_root=ARCHIVE_ROOT` via the deferred-import seam (preserves `monkeypatch.setattr(paths, "ARCHIVE_ROOT", tmp)`). `glossary.py` does NOT import `publisher.paths` — module boundary intact.
**FD divergence ratified**: u40 had no formal `functional-design/` directory; glossary logic lived only in the u40 plan + summary. To host this extension the planner authored `u40-financial-acronym-glossary/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` (L-glossary.1 baseline + L-glossary.2 cross-day suppression) and `business-rules.md` (R-glossary.1..3 baseline + R-glossary.4 recent-window scope), tagged `(extension 2026-05-24)`. Also ratified: lookback counts LOADED trading days (not calendar position), so a sparse archive can reach >3 calendar days back, capped by `_MAX_CALENDAR_DAYS=21` — consistent with u52 carryover semantics, documented in the helper docstring.

Gate: ruff clean / ruff format (changed) clean / mypy --strict 131 files clean / pytest 2443 passed (+25 new) / mkdocs --strict pass.
**Context**: Project rules upheld — no Anthropic SDK / paid API / new library (pure markdown + `re`/`pathlib`), module boundary intact (`glossary.py` does not import `publisher.paths`; orchestrator injects `archive_root`; briefing↔publisher boundary preserved), 면책조항/채널 분리 gates untouched, R13 no secret in the archive walk or callout. Fresh-repo / data-limited (`archive_root=None`) degrades to today-only with no regression (AC-68.4); missing/malformed/`OSError` archives contribute nothing and never raise.

## Construction — u67 domestic-channel-depth Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T12:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u67 (domestic-channel-depth) Code Generation landed — code/tests/fixtures/docs/tech-env/gate all green (developer). FD edit + `code/summary.md` deferred to planner per module-boundary rule.
**Decision**: Ratify the implementation and close the unit (7/7 steps). Two FD-vs-plan divergences ratified:
- **KOSDAQ has no Stooq tier** — live 2026-05-24 probing showed Stooq carries no `^kosdaq` symbol (all 5 variants `N/D`). KOSDAQ index-close precedence is two-tier (KRX → Yonhap-parse), not the plan's uniform "KRX → Stooq → yonhap-parse".
- **FX primary is Stooq `usdkrw`, not yfinance `KRW=X`** — yfinance returned HTTP 429 on the GHA path (live). The plan's reachability table listed yfinance first; Stooq `usdkrw` is the confirmed primary (200 / close 1518.21).
**Step 1 reachability (live 2026-05-24)**: Stooq `usdkrw` 200/1518.21 (FX primary); Stooq `^kospi` 200/7847.71; Stooq `^kosdaq` (+4 variants) all N/D; Yonhap `market.xml` 200 (UA required, best-effort numeric parse); 반도체/2차전지 already collected by `fsc-krx-stock-price` (grouping gap → prompt-only).
**Confirmed precedence**: 원/달러 = Stooq `usdkrw`. KOSPI close = KRX → Stooq `^kospi` → Yonhap parse. KOSDAQ close = KRX → Yonhap parse.
**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/u67-domestic-channel-depth/code/summary.md` (new — AC-1..AC-5 traceability, FD divergences, gate)

**Context**: Project rules upheld — 무료 API only (no-key Stooq + Yonhap), no Anthropic SDK touched, module boundary intact (no new cross-unit import), 면책조항/채널 분리 gates untouched, `defusedxml` only for the Yonhap RSS parse, R13 no secret introduced. New adapter `stooq-kr-market` registered (plugin-contract test 26→27). AC-4 needed no lint change — existing `cross_segment_lint` BC-3 already enforces domestic scope on the overnight bridge.

## Construction — Reader-Facing Feature Gaps (Review P2/P3) Decomposed into u66–u68
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-24T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: The 2026-05-24 ten-subagent reader-facing review surfaced P2/P3 *feature* gaps (not bugs) across four areas: A) crypto channel depth, B) domestic channel depth, C) checklist actionability, D) glossary position + carryover follow-up. The planner was asked to decompose into AIDLC units (next free number u66), score a priority backlog, and formally plan the highest-ROI unit only.
**Duplication audit (Gaps C/D)**:
- **C (watchpoint actionability)** — ALREADY DONE by **u64** (Steps 5/6): the watchpoint template (`무엇을 볼지` / `확인 소스` / `임계값/범위` / `시사점`) and the actionability validator already exist. No new unit; C is closed.
- **D — glossary position** — ALREADY DONE: `render_glossary_callout` is inserted in the **document header** (`pipeline.py` `_prepend_*`, above `오늘의 결론`), not the document end. The spec's "상단 이동" is satisfied; only an optional *inline* gloss variant is residual.
- **D — carryover follow-up** — ALREADY DONE by **u52**: `carryover_parser.load_carryover` walks §⑥ + lookahead table and tags `resolved`/`unresolved`/`carried_over`; `publisher/carryover.inject_carryover_block` renders the day-over-day table at the §②→§③ boundary. Only verification/strengthening is residual.
- Net residual of C/D is small → folded into a single low-priority unit **u68** rather than its own large unit.
**Decision**:
- Registered **u66 crypto-channel-depth** (largest net-new source cluster; per-indicator free reachability is the main risk → must be confirmed in-plan).
- Registered **u67 domestic-channel-depth** and authored its formal Code Generation plan as the **highest-ROI** unit (FX `usd_krw` mapping already half-built in `_core_fact_map.py`; index fallback + FX both reachable via existing yfinance/Stooq/yonhap adapters → lowest reachability risk, high reader value, several personas).
- Registered **u68 reader-aids-residual** (lowest priority; confirm-then-extend only).
**Stage Decision (u67)**: FD REQUIRED (lightweight — new index-close precedence algorithm + new domestic business rules; reuses `NormalizedItem`/`MarketAnchor`, no new entities). NFR SKIPPED (no new latency/cost/availability envelope; all free-tier reused; no new library; `defusedxml` already governs RSS).
**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u67-domestic-channel-depth-code-generation-plan.md` (new, formal)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/unit-of-work.md` (u66/u67/u68 registered)
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (u66/u67/u68 rows)
**Status**: u67 plan awaiting approval (Request Changes / Continue to Next Stage). u66 and u68 are backlog entries with scope + outline only.
**Context**: Project rules carried into all three plans — 무료 API only, Anthropic SDK 금지 (claude_code.py only), 모듈 경계 (orchestrator-only cross-unit import), 면책조항, 채널 분리, defusedxml, R13.

## Construction — u60 Shared Macro Evidence Hardening Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-23T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User asked to develop the u60 unit after the five-subagent review hardened the plan.
**Action**:
- Replaced shared macro bare-regex matching in `src/investo/orchestrator/bundle_context.py` with key-specific matcher predicates.
- Added source/category/title ranking so canonical macro evidence wins over earlier generic news.
- Added `ust_yield` canonical-source gate: at least two routed valid segments plus at least one `treasury-rates` or `fred-macro` candidate.
- Preserved u45 routing: `treasury-rates` fan-out remains valid; `fred-macro` remains US-only; `segments.py` was not changed.
- Added R13-safe shared macro diagnostics for accepted, rejected, suppressed, and selected candidates.
- Added unit/integration regressions covering `customers`, `trust`, `custody`, `dust`, `UST stablecoin`, `UST depeg`, `한국 국채`, real UST/FOMC/oil positives, boundary false positives, canonical evidence priority, and computed-context injection idempotency.
- Added code summary and cross-check report with known affected 2026-05-13 archives and no automatic backfill.
**Verification**: 48 targeted tests passed; targeted ruff passed; targeted mypy strict passed; mkdocs build strict passed.
**Status**: u60 construction, summary, and cross-check complete.

## Construction — u60 Shared Macro Evidence Hardening Planned
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-23T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User reported that the shared macro block kept rendering `미 국채 수익률 — Immunefi to absorb Code4rena bug bounty customers after shutdown decision`.
**Evidence**:
- `archive/domestic-equity/2026/05/2026-05-13.md`, `archive/us-equity/2026/05/2026-05-13.md`, and `archive/crypto/2026/05/2026-05-13.md` all contained the same wrong `미 국채 수익률` line.
- `src/investo/orchestrator/bundle_context.py::_SHARED_MACRO_PATTERNS["ust_yield"]` used bare `UST` with `re.IGNORECASE`, so `customers` matched as `ust`.
- Real UST data was present separately (`fred-macro` `DGS10 4.46` and `treasury-rates` `UST curve 2026-05-13: 10Y 4.46%`), proving this was representative-evidence selection drift rather than source absence.
**Decision**: Create a narrow follow-up unit, u60 `shared-macro-evidence-hardening`, instead of folding the work into u59. u59 owns macro actual collection and end-to-end lineage; u60 owns shared macro matcher correctness and canonical evidence priority.
**Action**:
- Added `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u60-shared-macro-evidence-hardening-code-generation-plan.md` with reproduction notes, matcher rules, evidence-ranking design, step checklist, acceptance criteria, tests, and closeout scope.
- Registered FR-015 in `docs/requirements.md`.
- Added u60 to `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`, `unit-of-work.md`, and `unit-of-work-story-map.md`.
**Status**: Planning only; implementation not started.

## TECH-DEBT — DEBT-046 Segment Market Clock Unification Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-14T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Medium TECH-DEBT continuation after DEBT-059.
**Action**:
- Added `src/investo/models/segments.py` as the foundation-layer catalog for `MarketSegment`, `SEGMENT_MARKET_TZ`, and `SEGMENT_MARKET_TZ_LABEL`.
- Updated `briefing/pipeline.py`, `sources/aggregator.py`, `models/market_calendar.py`, and `briefing/segments.py` to import the shared segment catalog.
- Added `tests/unit/models/test_segment_market_clock.py` to assert that `_render_timestamp_watermark` and `_window_for_adapter` produce the same UTC window for representative domestic-equity, us-equity, and crypto sources.
- Moved DEBT-046 from Medium Priority to Resolved Items in `docs/TECH-DEBT.md`.
**Verification**: Targeted ruff/format, mypy strict, and 53 targeted tests passed; full closeout gate recorded in the commit workflow.

## TECH-DEBT — DEBT-059 Weekly Flag Resolution Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-14T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User-directed continuation into Medium TECH-DEBT after DEBT-067 priority decision.
**Action**:
- Added `scripts/resolve_weekly_flags.py` to derive `INVESTO_PUBLISH_WEEKLY` and `INVESTO_WEEKLY_OPS_DIGEST` from scheduled-run KST wall-clock intent: GitHub `schedule` event during Asia/Seoul Saturday 09:00.
- Updated `.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml` to run the resolver before `python -m investo` and removed the exact cron-string expression `github.event.schedule == '0 0 * * 6'`.
- Added regression tests for scheduled Saturday 09:00, scheduled non-Saturday/non-09:00, manual dispatch default-off, `GITHUB_ENV` output, and workflow expression removal.
- Moved DEBT-059 from Medium Priority to Resolved Items in `docs/TECH-DEBT.md`.
**Verification**: Targeted ruff/format checks and targeted tests passed; full closeout gate recorded in the commit workflow.

## TECH-DEBT — DEBT-067 Priority Decision
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-14T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User-directed continuation order after u58; next planned item was the DEBT-067 status decision.
**Evidence**:
- u43 already landed the production-critical pieces that made DEBT-067 High: FOMC calendar, FRED economic calendar, orchestrator lookahead wire-through, single-filter reuse, and `LOOKAHEAD_DATA_MISSING`.
- Remaining DEBT-067 work is limited to CoinGecko/CoinMarketCal fallback selection and KRX option-expiry public-path discovery.
**Decision**: Demote DEBT-067 from High to Medium. Keep it active; do not resolve it until the remaining adapter decisions are closed or explicitly rejected.
**Action**: Updated `docs/TECH-DEBT.md` summary counts and moved DEBT-067 into Medium Priority with a 2026-05-14 status-decision note. Updated u43 plan/summary references so the planner-action note is no longer open.
**Verification**: Documentation-only decision; `git diff --check` and `uv run mkdocs build --strict` run as closeout gates.

## Construction — u58 Crypto-Regulation Policy Sources Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-14T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User-directed continuation after u51/u52/u53 evidence reconciliation; u58 was the next planned implementation target after the CLARITY Act markup omission.
**Action**:
- Added official U.S. crypto-policy adapters in `src/investo/sources/official_policy.py` for Congress.gov bill actions, Senate Banking official HTML watch URLs, and House Financial Services official RSS.
- Registered the adapters for discovery/tier handling and crypto market collection windows.
- Added `policy_priority=crypto_regulation` and `official_source=true` metadata routing so official policy events can enter the crypto segment without BTC/ETH/price tokens.
- Preserved official crypto-policy candidates ahead of generic LLM candidate caps.
- Added observational prompt rules for official regulation/legislation events and documented optional configuration in `docs/tech-env.md`.
- Added fixture-backed unit tests, routing tests, candidate-preservation tests, secret-redaction tests, and updated a stale integration assertion from `ok: 9 files` to the current SVG+manifest `ok: 18 files` visual-asset contract.
**Verification**: `uv run ruff check .` clean; changed-file `ruff format --check` clean; `uv run mypy --strict src/` clean (127 source files); targeted u58+integration tests 154 passed; `uv run pytest -q` 2326 passed; `uv run mkdocs build --strict` OK. Full-repo `ruff format --check .` still reports four pre-existing out-of-scope files.
**Status**: u58 construction, summary, and cross-check complete.

## Construction — u51/u52/u53 Evidence Reconciliation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-14T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: `/dev-investo` continuation preflight found commit `224a422` had already landed u51/u52/u53 code and tests, while `aidlc-state.md`, code summaries, and cross-check reports still showed planning-only state.
**Action**:
- Added code-generation summaries for u51, u52, and u53 under `aidlc-docs/construction/<unit>/code/summary.md`.
- Added cross-check reports for u51, u52, and u53 under `docs/cross-checks/2026-05-14-*.md`.
- Updated `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` per-unit rows from `📋 Planned` to `✅ Complete`.
- Closed u52's optional FR-registration step as deferred by design: existing FR-002/FR-006/FR-008 coverage is sufficient for this continuity correction.
**Verification**: Documentation-only reconciliation. The referenced implementation gate is the combined u51/u52/u53 gate from commit `224a422`: ruff, format, mypy strict, pytest 1910, mkdocs strict.
**Status**: u51/u52/u53 no longer appear as executable planned work; next planned implementation target remains u58 crypto-regulation-policy-sources.

## Construction — u57 — Segment Narrative Scope + Time Reconciliation Implementation Complete (Wave 8, 2026-05-13)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T18:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Refined u57 plan (8 steps, 45 checkboxes) executed end-to-end after planner re-hardened the plan to u51-level precision (BundleContext pre-computation, 3 untestable AC → measurable proxy rewrite, time-state regex catalogue, cross-market allow-list, shared macro dedupe).
**Outcome**: All 8 steps `[x]`, all DoD ACs `[x]`. Quality gate green — ruff clean (322 files), ruff format clean (322 files), mypy --strict clean (126 source files), pytest 2297 passed (2206 → +91; plan est. +52-70), mkdocs --strict OK.
**Delivered**:
- `briefing/time_state.py` — 6-label regex catalogue + `detect_time_state` deterministic priority resolver. `close` outranks `open` so "상승 출발 후 하락 마감" → `close`.
- `models/bundle_context.py` — `BundleContext` + `MarketStateSummary` foundation pydantic model + `CROSS_MARKET_CORE_ALLOWED` frozenset (`geopolitical_oil_macro` / `fed_policy_event` / `global_systemic_risk`). `with_self_pending(segment)` anti-self-assert helper.
- `orchestrator/bundle_context.py::compute_bundle_context` — pure pre-Stage-2 reducer. Latest time-stated routed item drives close-state; shared macro detected when ≥ 2 segments overlap.
- `publisher/cross_segment_lint.py` — `lint_domestic_foreign_linkage` / `lint_native_fact_priority` / `lint_time_state_consistency` / `run_all_cross_segment_lints` aggregator. Korean-boundary safe (`(?<![A-Za-z])` instead of `\b` because `\b` treats Hangul as word char).
- `publisher/shared_macro.py::inject_shared_macro_block` — idempotent `## ⓪ 오늘의 매크로` H2 inject after TL;DR / before §①.
- Stage-2 prompt — BC-1~BC-4 rule block + `{bundle_context}` placeholder + `format_bundle_context_section` helper.
- Orchestrator wire — `_stage_generate_segments` computes BundleContext once, threads through new `SegmentGenerateCallable` Protocol slot; `_apply_reader_format_to_segments` runs shared-macro inject + lint chain after u51 format.
- FR-013 registered in `docs/requirements.md` (FR-009=u51, FR-010=u54, FR-011=u55, FR-012=u56 점유; FR-013=u57).
**Decisions**:
- Pipeline ordering: Option B (BundleContext pre-comp) over Option A (reorder `SEGMENT_ORDER`). Pre-comp removes ordering coupling — domestic prompt no longer depends on US generation finishing first.
- Strict-mode default: `demote` (log-only; auto-strip deferred to D57-C). Lint emits WARN/REJECT records but the orchestrator does not yet rewrite paragraph contents — keeps NFR-001 risk low while still producing the audit surface.
- Foreign ticker pattern: static allowlist (well-known mega-caps + select Asian names). D57-A tracks the sources/ ticker registry auto-sync.
- R3 module boundary: `BundleContext` lives in `models/` (foundation) so orchestrator + briefing + publisher all import without violating the "no sibling imports" rule.
- R13 secret hygiene: lint extras carry segment / kind / severity / numeric lengths only. Test `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_cross_segment_lint_logging.py` pins the no-`raw_metadata` / no-secret-shaped-substring contract.
- Disclaimer enforcement (Rule 2): lint chain runs *before* `verify_disclaimer`; existing tests `test_apply_reader_format_preserves_disclaimer` continue to pin disclaimer survival.
**Quality gate**: ruff clean / format clean (322 files) / mypy --strict (126 src) / pytest 2297 / mkdocs build --strict.
**Test deltas**:
- `tests/unit/briefing/test_time_state.py` (25)
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_bundle_context.py` (17)
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_cross_segment_lint.py` (29)
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_shared_macro_block.py` (8)
- `tests/unit/models/test_bundle_context_allowlist.py` (6)
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_cross_segment_lint_logging.py` (2)
- `tests/integration/test_bundle_reconciliation.py` (6)
**DEBT 후보**:
- D57-A — `FOREIGN_TICKER_PATTERN` static allowlist; manual maintenance vs auto-sync against `sources/` ticker registry.
- D57-B — `lint_native_fact_priority` regex-only primary-noun extraction; Korean morphology (KoNLPy) would reduce false-negatives on subject-trailing constructions.
- D57-C — Strict-mode auto-demote path (rewrite offending paragraphs to background) currently log-only; `INVESTO_LINT_STRICT` env-var hook reserved.
- D57-D — Shared-macro auto-strip vs WARN-only: segment-specific 재해석을 false-positive 로 strip할 위험 때문에 현재 WARN-only.
**Context**: AIDLC Construction Wave 8 land. Next: u58 (TBD) or follow-up to address D57 series.

## Construction — u55 — Numeric / Date / Freshness Gate Implementation Complete (Wave 8, 2026-05-13)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T23:30:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Re-tightened u55 plan (7 steps, 50 checkboxes) executed end-to-end after prior session TCC-permission block was cleared.
**Outcome**: All 7 steps `[x]`, all 10 ACs `[x]`. Quality gate green — ruff/format clean (303 files), mypy --strict clean (119 files), pytest 2089 passed (1977 → +112; plan est. +44-56), mkdocs --strict OK.
**Delivered**: 10-element `CoreFact` Literal enum (`kospi_close ... vix`) + `CORE_FACT_KEYWORDS` (KR/EN) + `CORE_FACT_TOLERANCE` (Decimal-as-string) in `models/core_fact.py` / hand-rolled KRX 2026 + NYSE 2026 휴장일 in `models/market_calendar.py` (no paid calendar lib, NFR-002) / `SegmentResult(status: Literal["fresh","stale","failed"])` contract in `models/segment_result.py` / `briefing/numeric_verify.py` keyword-scoped window (WINDOW=40 chars) + Decimal tolerance compare + `NumericGateAction` 4-tier + downgrade callout / `briefing/date_corruption.py` slash-date regex + direction sanity vs `MarketAnchor` / `briefing/freshness.py` `evaluate_segment_freshness(segment, latest, now)` / `figures_verified` KPI sibling to `figures_presence` (`quality_eval.py` + `quality_history.py` + `visuals/quality_sparkline.py` purple series `#7e22ce`) / `OperatorAlerter.numeric_alert(kind, segment, detail)` with `numeric_block / numeric_downgrade / segment_stale` kinds (R13-safe template) / adapter contract: `stooq-price` + `yfinance-price` stamp `raw_metadata["core_fact:<name>"]` for known tickers (flat-key encoding because `_MetadataValue` rejects nested dicts).
**Design deviation**: plan assumed `raw_metadata["core_facts"]: dict[CoreFact, str]` nested dict; `_MetadataValue` allows only `StrictStr | StrictInt | StrictFloat` — switched to flat prefix key `core_fact:<name>` (deterministic, prefix-iteration safe, same surface to numeric_verify).
**Scope adjustment**: Step 4 plan called for full orchestrator signature migration (`dict[Segment, SegmentBriefing | None]` → `dict[Segment, SegmentResult]`). Adopted a *minimal* approach — `SegmentResult` model + `evaluate_segment_freshness` helper land as new public APIs, but orchestrator wire-through is deferred to a follow-up. Canary integration test (`tests/integration/test_numeric_gates_canary.py`) pins the 4-gate composition end-to-end against fixture markdown with planted violations (5/65/7 corruption, ATH lie, missing KOSPI source).
**Files**: 7 new src + 7 new tests + 5 modified (FR-011 registered in `docs/requirements.md`).
**TECH-DEBT candidates**: D55-A (USD/KRW + 10Y yield CoreFact activation; FRED endpoint free-tier check pending) / D55-B (market_calendar 2027 annual refresh) / D55-C (Korean-morpheme keyword window via KoNLPy free-rule trade-off) / D55-D (regenerate path on `block`) / **D55-E (NEW)**: orchestrator-side wire-through of `SegmentResult` + per-segment callout insertion (deferred from Step 4/6 to keep migration surgically small).
**Plan**: `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u55-numeric-freshness-and-market-fact-gates-code-generation-plan.md` (50/50).
**Summary**: `aidlc-docs/construction/u55-numeric-freshness-and-market-fact-gates/code/summary.md`.

## Construction — u57 — Segment Narrative Scope + Time-State Reconciliation Plan Re-Hardened to u51 Precision (Wave 8, 2026-05-13)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 10-agent evaluation of the initial u57 plan flagged 12 precision gaps relative to the u51 gold standard — (1) AC↔Step traceability + Open Questions 섹션 부재, (2) **3 untestable AC** ("downgraded to background unless link is explicit" / "native facts ranked above cross-market" / "domestic watchlist no unrelated global tickers") — quality gate 통과 불가, measurable proxy 필요, (3) `SEGMENT_ORDER = (DOMESTIC, US, CRYPTO)` 가 도메스틱 prompt 시점에 US close-state 미존재 — 05-11 bug 의 root cause; pre-computation 필요, (4) time-state detection mechanism (regex vs LLM) 미정, (5) "linkage" 결정 mechanism 미정, (6) cross-market 매크로 over-demotion 회귀 risk (Iran/oil 같은 material macro 소실), (7) shared macro dedupe 위치 (메타 stage vs in-context) 미정, (8) 통합 fixture 전략 (live cassette 녹화 vs synthetic) 미정, (9) pipeline ordering 변경 결정 미명시, (10) 영향 파일 + 예상 test count 미기재, (11) NFR + rule-compliance 섹션 부재, (12) FR id 할당 미실행.
**Decision**: u57 plan 을 in-place 재작성 (5 step → 8 step, ~20 checkbox → ~45 checkbox). **3개 untestable AC 모두 measurable proxy 채택**:
- AC1 (cross-market demotion) → 도메스틱 segment 본문에서 외국 ticker 매치 단락 안에 도메스틱 ticker `\d{6}` 또는 linkage 키워드 `{국내 영향, 환율 경로, 코스피 연관, 수급 영향, 외국인 매매, 환율, 원/달러}` ≥ 1 강제 (publish-gate regex lint).
- AC2 (native fact priority) → 각 segment §② 의 첫 H3 primary noun 이 segment-native entity allowlist (domestic: `\d{6}` ∪ KOSPI/KOSDAQ; us-equity: SPX/NDX/주요 ticker; crypto: BTC/ETH) 매치 강제 (WARN-tier diagnostic).
- AC3 (domestic watchlist global ticker) → AC1 의 linkage lint 와 동일 mechanism 으로 통합 + §watchlist subsection 한정 strict mode (linkage 키워드 ≥ 1 강제, REJECT-tier).

**BundleContext pre-computation Step 추가 (Step 1.5, Critical)**: 신규 `src/investo/models/bundle_context.py` (`MarketStateSummary` + `BundleContext`) + `src/investo/orchestrator/bundle_context.py` (`compute_bundle_context`); Stage 2 *전* raw routed items 만으로 3 segment 의 close-state 결정; 자기 segment 자신은 `pending` 으로 inject (회귀 안전 — 도메스틱 prompt 시점에 도메스틱 자신을 "이미 close" 라고 단정하지 않음); `SEGMENT_ORDER` 는 무수정 (Option B 채택; ordering 의존성을 pre-comp 로 제거).

**Cross-market core-tier allow-list 채택**: `CROSS_MARKET_CORE_ALLOWED: frozenset = {"geopolitical_oil_macro", "fed_policy_event", "global_systemic_risk"}` — over-demotion regression 방지; allow-list 매크로는 core 유지 가능하되 segment-specific 1-sentence 재해석 강제. 신규 항목 추가 (예: `currency_crisis_macro`, `commodity_shock`) 는 후속 unit out-of-scope.

**Time-state detection 결정**: source title regex catalogue (Yonhap 헤드라인 formulaic 해서 false-positive 낮음) + Stage-2 prompt 내 LLM in-context disambiguation (ambiguous 만); pattern catalogue `pre-market|open|intraday|close|post-close|scheduled` 모두 정규식 표 명시.

**Linkage lint mechanism**: post-Stage-2 deterministic regex (LLM 보조 없음); strict mode default = `demote` (paragraph 강등), `INVESTO_LINT_STRICT=reject` flag 로 전체 reject 모드 선택.

**Shared macro dedupe**: BundleContext.`shared_macro_block` 1회만 렌더, `## ⓪ 오늘의 매크로` H2 surface (TL;DR → § ⓪ → § ① 순서; u51 호환); 본문 재서술은 WARN-only (자동 strip false-positive 우려).

**Fixtures 전략**: synthetic unit-first; 3 segment 각각 독립 cassette (live Claude call 3개) 는 1회만 녹화; 통합 테스트는 frozen input + deterministic BundleContext replay.

**FR id 할당**: u51 = FR-009, u55 = FR-010 점유 확인. u57 = **FR-011** ("세그먼트 narrative scope + time-state 일관성").

**Options compared**:
- **(a) 기존 5-step plan 유지 + AC wording 손질만.** 거부됨 — 3 untestable AC 가 fundamental quality-gate blocker; pipeline ordering 결함이 measurable proxy 없이 단순 prompt 룰만으로 잡히지 않음.
- **(b) `SEGMENT_ORDER = (US, CRYPTO, DOMESTIC)` 으로 변경 + ordering 의존.** 거부됨 — KST 월요일 아침 cron 시점에 US 가 아직 close 가 아닌 케이스에서 여전히 깨짐; ordering coupling 강화로 단위 테스트 복잡도 증가.
- **(c) BundleContext pre-computation 채택 (Option B).** 채택 — ordering 무관화; pure function `compute_bundle_context` 가 재현성 (NFR-003) + mypy strict (NFR-004) 모두 만족; 신규 LLM call 0 (NFR-002).
- **(d) Cross-market allow-list 미채택 (모든 매크로 demote).** 거부됨 — us-equity 가 Iran/oil/Fed 같은 material macro 를 잃음 (subagent #8 회귀 우려); 3개 핀 allow-list 가 trade-off 균형.
- **(e) Linkage lint 를 LLM-assisted classification 으로.** 거부됨 — 비결정 (NFR-003 위반) + 비용 (NFR-002); regex linkage 가 결정론 + 무료.

**Affected docs**:
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u57-segment-narrative-scope-and-time-reconciliation-code-generation-plan.md` (in-place rewrite, ~45 checkbox).
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/audit.md` (this entry, top).
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/docs/requirements.md` (FR-011 추가는 Step 8 에서 — 아직 미실행).
- `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (u57 행은 `📋 Planned` 유지 — 개발 착수 시 전이).

**Status**: Planned (개발 미착수). Step 1 ~ Step 8 진행 전 사용자 승인 대기 (2-option completion).

**Context**: u55 / u57 모두 같은 2026-05-13 10-subagent 평가 wave 에서 도출. u55 는 numeric truth gate (publish-time fact verification), u57 은 cross-segment narrative coherence — 책임 명확히 분리. u52 의 prior-day carryover 와도 분리 (BundleContext 는 same-run only). u51 reader-format 과 layout 충돌 회피 (TL;DR → § ⓪ → § ① 순서).

## Construction — u56 — Compliance Language + Observational Tags Plan Re-Hardened (Findings #5 Crypto Disclaimer + #12 Retail Tone Absorbed)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 2026-05-13 10-subagent quality 리뷰의 u56-routed findings 가 초기 u56 plan (5 step / ~19 checkbox) 의 정밀도를 초과 — 특히 (a) Finding #5 "크립토 면책조항이 주식과 동일 — 가상자산이용자보호법 누락" 이 별 unit 으로 라우팅되지 않음, (b) Finding #12 "한국 retail 톤 — `-다` 종결 일색, `여부/전망/우려` 가족 어구 반복" 이 u51 §⑥ 한정 처리 외 잔여 surface 무owner, (c) P0 banned phrase 가 단방향 (`매수 검토` 만, `매도 검토` 부재) 비대칭, (d) `verify_disclaimer` 불변 invariant + first-viewport 신규 gate 의 직교성 (replace vs additive) 미명시, (e) ActionTag 5종→4종 마이그레이션 + alias map 정책 부재, (f) Context-aware false-positive (`목표가` quotative vs bare, `진입` 분야 진입, `청산` 회사 청산) 미고려, (g) AC↔Step traceability 표 + Open Questions 섹션 부재 (u51 gold-standard 격차). 사용자 직접 요청으로 본 unit 의 plan 을 u51 정밀도로 재보강.
**Decision**: u56 plan in-place 재작성 — 5 step → 9 step (Context filter / DISCLAIMER_CRYPTO / ActionTag migration / segment-aware verify_disclaimer / retail tone caps 각각 별 step), ~19 checkbox → ~70+ checkbox, AC↔Step traceability 표 신설, Open Questions 섹션 신설, P0 phrase 카탈로그 3 카테고리 구조화 (action symmetry / quantified outcome regex / Korean retail-coded + crypto-only subset), Finding #5 (가상자산이용자보호법 §10/§19 reference `DISCLAIMER_CRYPTO` 상수 + segment-aware `append_disclaimer` / `verify_disclaimer`) + Finding #12 (종결 어미 다양성 ≤ 60% + filler phrase family per-1000-chars cap, WARN-only) 통합. FR-010 할당.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) Finding #5 (crypto disclaimer) 와 Finding #12 (retail tone) 을 별 unit 으로 분리** (u58 / u59). 거부됨 — 두 finding 모두 publisher publish-time gate surface 동일 + compliance/wording owner 일치 (u56) — 분리 시 review/test cycle 중복 + orchestrator wire-through 중복.
- **(b) P0 phrase soften 자동 변환** (LLM 호출 또는 deterministic rewrite). 거부됨 — LLM 영역 침범 + 환각 risk; deterministic rewrite 는 wording 의 의미 변형 risk. 본 unit 은 WARN/block 만, 자동 rewrite 는 별 unit 후보 (regenerate path).
- **(c) `verify_disclaimer` 시그니처 변경 — segment 필수 인자**. 거부됨 — 기존 caller (weekly_digest / orchestrator / archive read path) 가 1-arg 호출. byte-compat 위해 `segment="us-equity"` default + `legacy=False` default 추가; 기존 caller 무파괴 + segment-aware 분기 활성화.
- **(d) `[관망]` tag 보존** (5종→4종 대신 5종 유지하되 wording만 변경). 거부됨 — `[관망]` 의 의미가 `[데이터부족]` 과 거의 중복 (둘 다 "관측 불가/판단 보류"). 4종으로 축소가 user-facing 명료성 ↑.

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: P0 vs P1 의 경계? A: P0 = compliance-critical (자본시장법 / 가상자산이용자보호법 referent — 차단). P1 = stylistic overconfidence (예: `직접 반영된다`, 인과 템플릿 — WARN only).
- Q: First-viewport short disclaimer 의 정확한 위치? A: `## 한눈에 보기` H2 직전 1줄 blockquote (u51 의 TL;DR 블록과 자연 stack). fallback path: anchor table 직전 → 본문 첫 줄.
- Q: Crypto-only P0 (`세력 / 김프 진입 / 상폐 임박 / 에어드랍 확정 / 펌핑`) 가 us-equity segment 에서 hit 시? A: segment="us-equity" 일 때 BANNED_P0_CRYPTO_ONLY 는 inactive — false-positive risk (`세력` 이 us-equity 본문에서 다른 의미로 사용될 가능성). crypto segment 에서만 active.
- Q: Archive backward-compat cutoff? A: 2026-05-13 (본 unit 시행일). 이전 archive 는 `legacy=True` flag 로 기존 `DISCLAIMER` substring 만 검사. 법 소급 무 — 재작성 안 함.
- Q: ActionTag 마이그레이션 시 과거 archive 재렌더? A: **재렌더 안 함**. legacy `[강세] / [약세]` 유지. pin-test 만 업데이트. 신규 생성물부터 신 tag 적용. notifier substring grep 은 union (구 5종 + 신 4종) — 단, 신규 prompt 에서는 신 tag 만 emit.
- Q: 종결 어미 60% / filler 8.0/1000 chars 임계 근거? A: u51 §⑥ "여부" 40% 와 동일한 evidence-driven 기준. archive 다일 sample 측정 후 implementation 시점 confirm — Open Question.
- Q: Filler phrase family 가 u51 §⑥ 액션 비율 metric 과 중복? A: 별 surface — u51 은 §⑥ 한정 bullet 종결, 본 unit 은 *본문 전체* prose 의 filler 빈도. 별 log signature (`reader_format.action_ratio_high` vs `tone.filler_density`).
- Q: Phrase list 위치 (`models/` vs `publisher/`)? A: `models/compliance_phrases.py` — briefing prompt + publisher gate 가 동일 import 가능. orchestrator-only cross-import 룰 위반 없음 (phrase list 는 *데이터*, foundation layer).
- Q: FR id? A: FR-009 (u51) 가 최고. **FR-010 = u56**.

**Affected docs**:
- 갱신: `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u56-compliance-language-and-observational-tags-code-generation-plan.md` (5 step → 9 step, ~19 → ~70+ checkbox 재작성)
- 갱신: `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/audit.md` (본 entry, 최상단)

- 향후 갱신 (developer Step 4, Step 6): `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/src/investo/publisher/reader_format.py` (first-viewport disclaimer emit + tone caps)
- 향후 갱신 (developer Step 1): `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/src/investo/briefing/prompts.py` (P0 forbid 명시 + ActionTag 5종→4종)
- 향후 갱신 (developer Step 7): `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/src/investo/notifier/summary.py` (신규 ActionTag substring 추출)

**Status**: 📋 Planned (re-hardened) — developer 가 Step 1 부터 시작 대기. 2-option approval 미실행 (사용자 승인 대기). **No code written.**

**Context**: 10-subagent 평가의 12개 findings 중 finding 라우팅 (u51-u57) 1차 분배 후 u56 plan 의 정밀도 격차가 사후 발견 — 특히 Finding #5 (crypto disclaimer) 와 Finding #12 (retail tone) 가 u56 owner 임에도 초기 plan 에 미흡 반영. 본 재보강은 *plan-only delivery* (코드 변경 없음). Rule 2 (Disclaimer enforcement) 의 surface 가 footer 단일 → footer + first-viewport + crypto-variant 의 3-surface gate 로 hardened.

**DEBT cross-references** (Open Questions 에 명시):
- D56-A: `DISCLAIMER_CRYPTO` wording 정식 법률 검토 (변호사 자문).
- D56-B: 종결 어미 분류기 형태소 분석 (regex → KoNLPy 등) — 정확도 ↑, 의존 무게 trade-off.
- D56-C: P0 phrase list 정기 갱신 cadence (자본시장법 / 가상자산법 개정 추적).
- D56-D: Quantified outcome regex 다국어 case (영문 혼용).

## Construction — u54 — Plan Refined to u51-Level Precision + Finding #4 (Citation Cardinality) Inception (Wave 8 Second-Pass Evaluation, 2026-05-13)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 10-agent second-pass evaluation of the initial u54 plan against u51 (gold-standard precision baseline) flagged 11 refinement items — (1) AC↔Step traceability 표 부재, (2) Open Questions / Risks 섹션 부재, (3) 영향 파일 분기 ("Extend or wrap `SegmentCoverage`") — 단일 결정 미pinned, (4) 4-tier 신규 enum vs 기존 3-tier `CoverageStatus = Literal["normal","partial","insufficient"]` (`src/investo/briefing/segments.py:13`) 마이그레이션 정책 부재, (5) Core source set 추상 ("price/index, primary market news") — frozen constant 미정의, (6) Severity 결정 트리 비결정적 (4-tuple → severity 표 부재), (7) Staleness signal 미포함 (주말/공휴일 yfinance 가 stale close 반환 시 `정상` 라벨 risk), (8) Alert debouncing + same-day re-publish 정책 부재, (9) **Finding #4 (citation cardinality)** — 평가에서 1 연합뉴스 URL 이 5 distinct 종목 claim 에 묶인 over-attribution 발견했으나 u54 plan 에 미인입, (10) NFR + project-rule compliance 섹션 부재, (11) 영향 파일 + 예상 test count 부재.

**Decision**: u54 plan in-place 재작성 (planning-only delivery; **No code written**). 5 step → **9 step** 으로 분해, 22 → **44 checkbox** (DoD 9 + Step 1 9 + Step 2 4 + Step 3 5 + Step 4 5 + Step 5 6 + Step 6 5 + Step 7 4 + Step 8 4 + Step 9 6). 신규 섹션: AC↔Step traceability 표 (8 AC × 9 step), Frozen constants 표 (`SEGMENT_CORE_SOURCES` + 8-row severity decision tree + 3-tier→4-tier 마이그레이션 표), Step Dependency Graph, NFR AC coverage map, Project rule compliance (R13 명시), Affected files (concrete 12 modify + 10 new test), Open questions / risks (7건 + DEBT 후보 4건). Finding #4 → Step 6 의 sub-step 으로 인입 (신규 `briefing/citation_cardinality.py` pure 헬퍼, `reader.citation_cardinality_exceeded` WARN, url_hash sha1[:12] R13 보호, *non-blocking*). FR-010 `docs/requirements.md` 할당.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) plan 보강 없이 implementation 진입.** 거부 — 5 step 의 추상도가 implementation 분기를 야기 (4-tier enum 도입 방식 / core source 결정 / staleness 정책 미pinned).
- **(b) AC↔Step 표 + Open Questions 만 추가.** 거부 — Finding #4 미인입, severity 결정 트리 미pinned, 마이그레이션 정책 부재 → u51-level 정밀도 미달.
- **(c) 전면 재작성 + Finding #4 인입 + 9 step.** 채택. u51 의 38 checkbox / 7 step 정밀도와 동등 (44 / 9 — citation cardinality + alert debounce + staleness 추가로 step 수 ↑).
- **(d) Finding #4 를 별 unit (u58+) 으로 분리.** 거부 — citation cardinality 는 source-status 신뢰도의 일부 (1 source 가 N claim 에 묶이는 것은 attribution risk = trace transparency 영역). u54 의 Step 6 (trace transparency) 의 자연 확장.

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: 4-tier enum 도입 시 기존 3-tier `CoverageStatus` 와 병행? A: 병행 없음. 단일 enum 으로 통합 — `insufficient` → `failed` 마이그레이션, `limited` 를 `partial` 과 `failed` 사이에 신규 삽입. 모든 다운스트림 (briefing/pipeline.py, visuals/cards.py, visuals/assets.py, notifier/summary.py, orchestrator/pipeline.py) 단일-PR 마이그레이션.
- Q: Severity 결정 트리의 핵심 input? A: `(failed_core_count, zero_core_count, required_category_zero, all_items_zero, core_staleness_violated)` 5-tuple. 8-row 결정 표가 deterministic 매핑.
- Q: `SEGMENT_CORE_SOURCES` 정확 구성? A: domestic `{fsc-krx-index-price}` (1 required) / us-equity `{yfinance-price, stooq-price}` (at-least-one — u46 dual price fallback 활용) / crypto `{coingecko-price, binance-crypto-market}` (at-least-one). domestic 의 `krx-foreign-flows` 는 narrative-critical 이지만 core 아님 — `partial` 만 야기.
- Q: Staleness window 의 segment 별 길이? A: us-equity 30h (KST Mon cron 가 Sun 22:00 ET 에 Fri 16:00 ET close 를 ~24h 후 읽어야 정상 — Mon-after-weekend 케이스 tolerant), domestic 30h (KST overnight + weekend tolerant), crypto 6h (24/7 시장 — fresh 기대).
- Q: Citation cardinality 임계 N? A: N=3. 평가의 5/1 케이스는 명백 위반; N=2 는 false-positive risk (같은 회사 2개 ticker 정상 케이스).
- Q: Citation WARN extra 의 R13 보호? A: `url_hash = sha1(url)[:12]` — 원본 URL 미노출. structured extra 는 `{url_hash, claim_count, segment}` 만. 카나리 테스트 `test_warn_extra_no_raw_url`.
- Q: Alert debounce window? A: 2-run consecutive (≥ `limited`). 1-run debounce 가 KST 일 1회 cron 환경에서 ~24h detection lag — 수용. FR-007 hard-failure 경로 (pipeline 자체 실패) 는 debounce 미적용.
- Q: Same-day re-publish 의 worst-wins 강제? A: `append_quality_snapshot(keep_worst=True)` default. 운영자 manual override 필요 시 `coverage.jsonl` 직접 편집 — 본 unit 의 코드 path 미제공 (DEBT 후보 if 재발).
- Q: FR id 할당? A: FR-010 (FR-009 = u51 다음 free id).

**Affected docs**:

**Status**: 📋 Planned — developer 가 Step 1 (4-tier enum migration) 부터 시작 대기. 2-option approval (Request Changes / Continue to Next Stage) 미실행 (사용자 승인 대기). **No code written**.

**Context**: Wave 8 (2026-05-13 multi-segment briefing quality review) 의 5 unit (u54-u57+) 중 u54 가 source-status 신뢰도 layer. Finding #4 (citation cardinality) 가 trace transparency surface 의 자연 확장으로 같은 unit 에 인입 — 별 unit 분리 시 reviewer overhead 증가. u51/u52/u53 (Wave 7) 와 surface 분리 (reader-format / carryover / data acquisition 각각), 동시 머지 가능. u55 (numeric-freshness) 와는 staleness 정의가 다른 surface — u54 는 source 의 latest-item-at, u55 는 briefing prose 안의 number freshness.

**DEBT cross-references**:
- 후보 D54-A: KRX index adapter timestamp source — `fsc-krx-index-price` 응답에 명시적 `latest_at` 부재 시 last-trading-day 캘린더 derivation 필요.
- 후보 D54-B: claim entity dictionary 유지보수 — ticker + watchlist 종목명 list 가 u53 watchlist 와 동기화 필요 (drift risk).
- 후보 D54-C: 2-run debounce 가 spam 흡수 불충분 시 3-run 으로 promotion.
- 후보 D54-D: cross-segment severity 가중치 — 오늘 segment 별 독립, 3 segment 모두 `limited` 시 page-level red banner 격상 미제공.

## Construction — u55 — Numeric / Freshness / Market-Fact Gates Plan Re-Tightened to u51 Precision (Wave 8, 2026-05-13)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 10-agent evaluation of the initial u55 plan flagged 10 precision gaps relative to the u51 gold standard — (1) AC↔Step traceability + Open Questions 부재, (2) "claim extraction patterns" framing 이 자유 한국어 prose 에서 regex 로 추출은 비현실 — typed lookup 으로 전환 필요, (3) tolerance 상수 미명시, (4) market calendar source 미정 (무료/유료 룰 불명확), (5) conflict action enum 미정 (`block` vs `downgrade` vs `warn` 매핑), (6) date corruption gate 가 u51 reader_format 과 겹치는 이유 미설명, (7) per-segment freshness 의 publisher contract 변경 부재, (8) 영향 파일 경로 + 예상 test count 미기재, (9) NFR + rule-compliance 섹션 부재, (10) FR id 할당 미실행.
**Decision**: u55 plan 을 in-place 재작성 (5 step → 7 step, ~20 checkbox → ~50 checkbox). **Core framing 전환**: 자유 prose claim extraction 폐기 → `CoreFact: Literal[10개]` typed lookup. Source adapter 가 `Item.raw_metadata["core_facts"]: dict[CoreFact, Decimal-as-string]` 방출; verification 은 keyword scoped window (anchor 토큰 ± 40 chars) 내 첫 매치를 tolerance 비교. u32 `numeric_self_check.find_unverified` (substring presence gate) 는 무수정 — 신규 `briefing/numeric_verify.py` 가 sibling 으로 tolerance-based core-fact verifier 책임. `figures_presence` (u32) 와 `figures_verified` (u55) 가 quality 페이지 + `quality_history` 양쪽에 append-only 두 column. **Calendar source 결정**: hand-rolled 정적 `src/investo/models/market_calendar.py` (KRX 2026 + NYSE 2026 휴장일 list; URL 코멘트로 박음); 크립토 24/7; 유료 API (tradingeconomics, pandas-market-calendars) **금지** 명시 (NFR-002 + R10). **Conflict action enum**: `NumericGateAction = Literal["pass","warn","downgrade","block"]` — anchor 충돌 (ATH 거짓) `block`, unverified core fact `downgrade` (본문 상단 `> ⚠️ 확인 필요` callout), non-core unverified `warn` (operator alert). **Per-segment freshness contract**: 신규 `SegmentResult(segment, status: Literal["fresh","stale","failed"], briefing, stale_reason)` orchestrator 출력 — publisher 는 `fresh` 만 archive/Telegram 발행, `stale`/`failed` 은 quality 라인 + operator alert (공개 채널 무발송, FR-007). **FR id 할당**: u51 이 FR-009 → u55 는 **FR-010**.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) 기존 5-step plan 유지 + minor edits.** 거부됨 — 10-agent 평가에서 도출된 framing 결함 (특히 prose claim extraction) 이 fundamental, surface-level fix 로 안 잡힘.
- **(b) Free-form prose claim extraction (모든 숫자 추출 시도) + LLM-assisted classification.** 거부됨 — LLM 호출 추가 비용 (NFR-002), 비결정 (NFR-003), 잡음 폭주 risk. typed lookup 이 결정론적 + 무료.
- **(c) `figures_presence` 를 `figures_verified` 로 in-place 교체.** 거부됨 — backward-compat 깨짐 (history JSONL), u32 substring gate 는 별도 가치 (전체 숫자 presence 감지). append-only 가 정답.
- **(d) Calendar 를 외부 라이브러리 (pandas-market-calendars / exchange-calendars).** 거부됨 — 무료 룰 위반 위험 (pandas-market-calendars 자체는 무료지만 transitive deps + 의존 무게), 본 unit 의 필요는 2026 휴장일 list 만 — hand-rolled 정적 데이터로 충분. 2027 갱신은 annual maintenance (DEBT-D55-B).
- **(e) Anchor 충돌 시 `downgrade` 만 (block 안 함).** 거부됨 — 사실 무결성 우선; ATH 거짓 같은 정면 충돌은 block 이 맞음. false-positive 잦으면 사용자 회고로 완화 가능 (Open Question).

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: 10개 CoreFact 선정 기준? A: 본문에 가장 자주 등장 + source adapter 가 안정적으로 emit + segment 별 1차 anchor. kospi_close / kosdaq_close / spx_close / ndx_close / dji_close / btc_usd / eth_usd / usd_krw / us10y_yield / vix. usd_krw + us10y_yield 는 MVP 에서 source 부재 → `warn` 만 (Phase-2 DEBT-D55-A 활성화).
- Q: Keyword scoped window 크기? A: 40 chars 시작. 한국어 prose 의 키워드↔숫자 거리 분포 측정 후 조정 — Open Question.
- Q: Tolerance 상수 절대 vs 상대? A: 모두 절대. 종가 ±0.01 Decimal, percent move ±0.05pp, yield ±1bp, BTC ±$1, ETH ±$0.5, FX ±0.10 원.
- Q: u32 와 u55 의 KPI 관계? A: 두 column 공존 (append-only). figures_presence = u32 substring gate (모든 본문 숫자 대비 source 매치 비율), figures_verified = u55 core-fact tolerance gate (등장한 CoreFact 대비 verified 비율). 분모 다름 — 의도된 차이.
- Q: figures_verified 의 분모? A: 본문에 등장한 CoreFact 만 분모. 안 쓴 CoreFact 를 penalty 로 잡으면 segment 마다 자연스러운 0 점 발생.
- Q: SegmentResult 마이그레이션이 publisher path 깨뜨리는가? A: 기존 `dict[Segment, SegmentBriefing | None]` lookup 자리에 `result.briefing if result.status == "fresh" else None` 패턴으로 1줄 변환. backward-compat 보장 — `failed` 케이스 동일 처리.
- Q: Date corruption regex 가 표 셀 / 코드 블록 내부 매치 risk? A: u51 의 `wrap_numbers_bold` 와 동일 negative-context (코드 블록 fence 감지) 적용. 한국어 "5월 11일" 류 토큰은 슬래시 부재로 무영향.
- Q: Operator alert R13 검증? A: 모든 structured extra 가 secret-shaped substring 미포함 (input 은 LLM output + Decimal 만; redaction layer 가 상위에서 이미 적용). Step 5 canary 로 핀.
- Q: u54 (source-status severity) 와 KPI 충돌? A: u54 가 `정상` 의 진실성 (source liveness) 책임, u55 가 `정상` 안에서의 숫자 진실성 (fact verification). 양 surface 공존, quality 페이지 column 분리.

**Affected docs**:
- 갱신: `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u55-numeric-freshness-and-market-fact-gates-code-generation-plan.md` (재작성, 5 step → 7 step, ~20 → ~50 checkbox)

- 향후 갱신 (developer Step 7): `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/docs/DESIGN.md` (briefing pipeline 다이어그램 `numeric_verify` + `freshness` 노드 추가)

**Status**: 📋 Planned (re-tightened) — developer 가 Step 1 부터 시작 대기. 2-option approval 미실행 (사용자 승인 대기).

**Context**: u55 의 첫 plan 은 9개 다른 Wave 8 unit 과 함께 일괄 작성되어 step 수 / checkbox 수 / framing 정밀도가 u51 gold standard 대비 부족. 10-agent 평가로 도출된 결함 10종을 in-place 재보강. CoreFact typed lookup 으로의 framing 전환이 가장 중요한 결정 — 자유 prose claim extraction 의 비결정성을 제거하고 source adapter 의 명시 contract 로 verifier 의 분모를 닫음. market_calendar 의 hand-rolled 결정은 NFR-002 무료 룰의 명시적 strengthening (외부 라이브러리 거부의 audit trail). per-segment SegmentResult contract 는 u54 / u57 의 future hooks 와도 정합 (status enum 이 segment 별 graceful degradation 의 표준 surface). **No code written** — planning-only delivery.

**DEBT cross-references**:
- **D55-A**: USD/KRW + 10Y yield CoreFact 활성화 (FRED 무료 endpoint 후보 검증 필요).
- **D55-B**: market_calendar 2027 갱신 (annual maintenance).
- **D55-C**: keyword scoped window 의 한국어 형태소 분석 (KoNLPy) 정확도 향상 — 무료 룰 무위반, 의존 무게 trade-off (u51 의 동일 DEBT 후보와 평행).
- **D55-D**: regenerate path — `block` 시 LLM 재시도 (현재는 segment 발행만 거부 + operator alert).

## Construction — u51 — Reader-Facing Output Format Unit Planned (Wave 7, 2026-05-13 10-Subagent Quality Review)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 10-subagent quality 리뷰 (2026-05-13 session) 가 `archive/us-equity/2026/05/2026-05-11.md` 를 대상으로 6종 reader-facing 결함을 도출 — (1) 자급식 TL;DR 부재 ("3대 지수 상승 마감" 류 일반론, 매그니튜드 미표시), (2) 앵커 prose wall (250자 한 줄에 5개 지수+티커 mixed pct/abs), (3) `**Title** — body` 패턴이 §②/③/④/⑥ 전부 — H3 nav 부재, Telegram wall, (4) bold 반전 (섹션 타이틀 굵게, `+11.51%` / `$81,154.06` / `4.42%` 핵심 숫자 plain), (5) §⑥ 관전 포인트 5건 중 4건이 `~여부 / ~필요가 있다` 종결 — 액션성 zero, (6) `S&P 500(스탠더드앤드푸어스 500 지수)` 글로싱 같은 파일 내 3회 반복.
**Decision**: Wave 7 의 u51 tldr-block-and-number-bold-inversion code-generation plan 작성 (planning-only delivery; **No code written**). Stage-2 prompt 룰 추가 + publisher post-format 헬퍼 신규 (`publisher/reader_format.py`) + 앵커 표 승격 + orchestrator wire-through 의 4축 분해, 7 step. `aidlc-state.md` 에 u51 행 추가.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) Stage-2 prompt 룰만 추가, post-format 헬퍼 없음.** 거부됨 — generation 변동성 흡수 어렵고, "여부" 비율 / 글로싱 dedupe 같은 deterministic 검증을 LLM 에 위임하면 환각 risk + 비결정.
- **(b) post-format 헬퍼만 (prompt 무변경).** 거부됨 — TL;DR 블록 본문 생성은 LLM 영역; heuristic placeholder 는 fallback 일 뿐 일차 source 가 아님. prompt 룰이 일차, post-format 이 이차.
- **(c) prompt + post-format 결합, blocking on 위반.** 거부됨 — "여부" 비율 같은 stylistic 룰을 blocking 하면 generation 실패 risk; *flag only* (WARNING + 카나리) 가 정답. 사용자 회고에서 엄격 block 요구 시 별 unit 격상.
- **(d) 6 결함을 6 mini-unit 으로 분해.** 거부됨 — 모두 reader-facing 출력 surface 의 동일 chokepoint (`_enhance_reader_experience` 직후 publish path) 에 얹히므로 단일 unit 이 review 효율 ↑.

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: TL;DR 블록의 정확한 위치? A: 워터마크/segment-nav/anchor 라인 다음, 본문 § 시작 *전*. `## 한눈에 보기` H2 + 정확히 3 bullet.
- Q: 앵커 표 vs 기존 anchor 라인 — backward-compat? A: 표가 라인을 *대체* (deprecate). anchor 가 비면 둘 다 생략 — backward-compat 자연 보존.
- Q: 핵심 숫자 wrap 시 표 cell 내부 / 코드 블록 내부 처리? A: 둘 다 제외. regex 의 negative-context 처리 (코드 블록 fence 감지 + `|...|` 행 감지).
- Q: "여부" 비율 임계? A: ≤ 40% (5건 중 2건 이하). 사용자 회고가 5건 중 4건 (80%) 을 "폭주" 로 표현 — 절반 + 여유 margin.
- Q: glossing dedupe 의 첫 출현 보존 기준? A: 같은 base 용어 (괄호 앞 부분) 의 첫 출현만 `(풀어쓰기)` 보존, 2회차 이상은 괄호 부분만 strip. u40 의 `> **용어 가이드**` callout 은 별 surface 라 무영향.
- Q: regenerate path 가 필요한가? A: 본 unit 은 *flag only* (WARNING + canary). regenerate 는 별 unit 격상 가능 — 본 plan 의 Out of scope 에 명시.
- Q: FR id 할당? A: Step 6 진입 전 `docs/requirements.md` 의 현재 free id 확인 — Open Question 으로 남김.
- Q: u52 (병렬) 와의 충돌 risk? A: u52 의 § 텍스트 anchor 의존 (markdown 정규식) 이 본 unit 의 H3 sub-heading 승격 (§②/③/④/⑥) 과 *부분 겹침*. § 자체 H2 텍스트 ("⑥ 관전 포인트 / 변동성 트리거") 는 본 unit 미변경 — sub-heading 만 H3 로 승격. u52 의 markdown-anchor 가 § H2 만 의존하면 충돌 zero. implementation 시점에 cross-verify.

**Affected docs**:
- 신규: `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u51-tldr-block-and-number-bold-inversion-code-generation-plan.md`
- 갱신: `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (u51 행 추가)
- 갱신: `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/aidlc-docs/audit.md` (본 entry, 최상단)
- 향후 갱신 (developer Step 6): `/Users/user/Desktop/Projects/investo/docs/requirements.md` (FR-XXX 추가)

**Status**: 📋 Planned — developer 가 Step 1 부터 시작 대기. 2-option approval (Request Changes / Continue to Next Stage) 미실행 (사용자 승인 대기).

**Context**: u49 (deterministic-market-anchor) + u50 (lightweight-charts-embed) 의 visual surface 가 안정화된 이후 reader-facing 출력 *layout* 의 다음 layer. 앵커 표는 u49 의 anchor 모듈 재사용, prompt 룰은 u7 segmented-briefing 의 Stage-2 prompt 에 얹힘, glossing dedupe 는 u40 callout 과 별 surface — dependency graph 가 깔끔히 layered. u52 (carryover) / u53 (coverage gap) 와는 별 surface (reader-facing layout), 동시 머지 가능. **No code written.**

**DEBT cross-references**:
- 후보 (Open Questions 에 명시): 한국어 종결 어미 stemmer 정확도 향상 (regex → KoNLPy 등 — 무료 룰 무위반, 의존 무게 trade-off) / 숫자 wrap regex false-negative (`5%` 단일 digit edge) / 글로싱 dedupe false-positive (의도적 재정의 케이스).

## Construction — u53 — KRX Foreign Flows + Sector/Macro ETF Coverage Planned (Wave 7, 2026-05-11 Coverage Gap Retrospective)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 2026-05-11 segmented briefing 데이터 커버리지 회고. (1) domestic 시황이 본문에서 "이번 주 외국인 수급 확인이 요점" 으로 자백 — 본문이 외국인 수급에 블라인드. (2) us-equity 2026-05-11 ②에서 "이번 집계에 섹터별 ETF 수급 데이터가 포함되지 않아 세부 섹터 흐름을 직접 확인할 수 없다" 명시. 두 결함 모두 Stage 2 prompt 룰이 아니라 **입력 자체에 데이터가 없는** root cause. u51/u52 는 별도 병렬 작성 중 (다른 gap).
**Decision**: Wave 7 단일 unit `u53 krx-foreign-flows-and-sector-etf` 로 두 gap 을 한 unit 에 묶음 — 둘 다 *어댑터 layer 만* 건드리고 (`sources/` + `tiers.py` + `segments.py` 1줄 + ticker constant 확장), UI 변경 없음. Plan only — no code written.

**Endpoint accessibility 검증 (planning-time probe, 2026-05-13)**:
- **KRX 12025 (`getJsonData.cmd` bld=`MDCSTAT02501`)**: HTTP 400 `LOGOUT` 반환 — UA/Referer 헤더 갖춰도 동일, `GenerateOTP/generate.cmd` 도 `LOGOUT` 6 byte. 세션 쿠키만으로 부족; 브라우저 JS 가 만드는 추가 토큰 필요. **차단 확인** → 무료/공개 룰 (NFR Critical Rule) 불충족.
- **Naver finance `investorDealTrendDay.naver?bizdate=YYYYMMDD&sosok={01|02}`**: HTTP 200, ~8 KB, 일자별 외국인/기관/개인 순매수 금액 테이블, EUC-KR, UA 만으로 충분. **채택 = primary**.
- **Stooq 14 신규 ticker** (xlk.us, xle.us, xlf.us, xlv.us, xly.us, xli.us, smh.us, iwm.us, tlt.us, gld.us, uso.us, uup.us, cl.f, gc.f): 14/14 HTTP 200 정상 OHLCV. **채택 = primary**.
- **Stooq `bz.f` (Brent), `^rut`**: HTTP 200 이지만 `N/D` 응답. **거부 → yfinance v8 chart fallback** (u49 가 이미 사용 중).

**Options compared**:
- (a) KRX 12025 reverse-engineering 으로 직접 endpoint 사용. **거부** — 토큰 메커니즘이 비공식 (HTML JS 파싱 의존, 변경 시 silent break), 무료/공개 정신에 어긋남.
- (b) 외국인 수급 / 섹터 ETF 두 별 unit 분할. **거부** — 둘 다 어댑터 layer 작업이고 quality gate / fixture 녹화 / segment 라우팅 테스트 의존성을 공유 (test_segments_exclusivity.py 가 양쪽 routing 을 함께 검증). 한 unit 에 묶으면 review/test cycle 1회로 종결.
- (c) 채택 — Naver fallback for KR + Stooq `_TICKER_MAP` 확장 for US + yfinance Brent/^RUT fallback. 코드 변경 최소화 (신규 어댑터 1개 + 기존 어댑터의 constant 확장).

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: KRX 12025 가 차단되었는데 Naver mirror 사용은 source-of-truth 정합성에서 문제 없나? A: Naver finance 가 KRX raw 데이터를 mirror — 같은 수치이지만 layer 가 추가됨. Tier `"A"` 등록 (regulator-of-record 가 아니므로 S 아님). KRX 12025 토큰 reverse-engineering 은 DEBT-D53-A 로 등록 (long-term).
- Q: 한 unit 에 KR adapter (Naver) + US ticker 확장 (Stooq/yfinance) 을 묶는 이유? A: 두 결함 모두 *입력 데이터 부재* 라는 동일 root cause + 어댑터 layer 만 건드림 + segments_exclusivity test 공유. Wave 6 의 u45 가 routing 만 / u46 이 source 만 분리했던 것과 달리, 본 unit 은 source 추가만 (routing 은 1줄 + 기존 테스트 확장).
- Q: Commodity proxy (GLD/USO/UUP/CL=F/GC=F) segment 분류? A: MVP us-equity 단독. "유가 급등 → 코스피 정유주" 같은 cross-segment narrative 가 자주 발견되면 별 unit 으로 격상. u45 의 `_has_strong_crypto_signal` ticker regex 에 매치 안 되므로 자연 us-equity 만 routing.
- Q: HTML parser 선택? A: Step 2 시작 시 `pyproject.toml` 의존성 확인 후 final. lxml.html (빠름) vs BeautifulSoup4 (forgiving). R8 (no raw stdlib XML) 만 강제.
- Q: 외국인 종목별 Top N (Naver `sise_deal_rank.naver`) 도 포함? A: MVP 미포함, 시장 합산만. 별 unit 후보 (DEBT-D53-B).

**DEBT cross-references** (Open Questions 에 명시):
- D53-A: KRX 12025 직접 endpoint 토큰 reverse-engineering (Naver fallback 의존성 제거).
- D53-B: 외국인 종목별 Top N 어댑터 (sector breakdown gap).
- D53-C: Stooq `^rut` / `bz.f` N/D 영구성 — `_TICKER_MAP` 에서 제거 정책.

## Construction — u52 — Prior Briefing Context and Carryover Planned (Day-Over-Day Continuity Gap)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 사용자 직접 (2026-05-13 evaluation) — 2026-05-06 → 05-07 → 05-08 시황 연쇄 평가에서 day-over-day 연속성 부재 결함 적시. (1) 05-06 이 05-05 참조 zero (standalone preview), (2) 05-06 의 ARM/APP/UBER/DIS/NVO/WBD 어닝 예고가 05-07/05-08 follow-up zero, (3) 05-07 highlighted LNG/VST/TRGP/COIN 을 05-08 reporting 안 함, (4) 05-07 베어리시 → 05-08 [강세] ATH 경신 사이 brief bridge 1줄 + flow-of-funds 설명 zero, (5) DGS10/UST/FRED/Regulation FD 용어 매일 재정의. 결함 (1)-(4) 는 carryover discipline 부재; (5) 는 별 surface (u40 glossary 확장).
**Decision**: Wave 7 u52 신규 code-generation plan 작성. `aidlc-state.md` per-unit progress row + 본 audit entry 추가. **No code written** — planning-only delivery.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) u34 recent-briefings-context 확장만으로 처리.** 거부됨 — u34 는 narrative continuity (어제 결론 1줄 인용) surface 이고, 본 결함은 *event-level lifecycle tracking* (originated → expected → resolved/unresolved/이월). free-form 결론 인용은 LLM 이 1-2 문장으로 휘발시키는 패턴 (05-08 시황이 정확히 그렇게 작동). 구조화된 표가 필요.
- **(b) Stage 2 prompt 룰만으로 강제 (carryover discipline 룰 추가).** 거부됨 — prompt-only 는 LLM 환각 risk (예: 존재하지 않는 어제 항목을 발명). 결정론적 파서 + LLM override 가 정답 (u49 anchor 와 동일 패턴 — 결정론적 fact + prompt rule 결합).
- **(c) 신규 unit u52 (모델 + 파서 + prompt + renderer + wire-through).** 채택. 의존 그래프 깔끔 (u34 narrative + u52 structured 공존, u35 lookahead 표를 carryover unresolved source 로 재사용, DEBT-060 chokepoint 6번째 consumer 등장).

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: u52 와 u34 의 surface 분리? A: u34 = narrative continuity (free-form 1줄 인용, `{recent_context}` prompt placeholder). u52 = event-level lifecycle (구조화 표, `{carryover_context}` placeholder, deterministic markdown post-process). prompt 룰 ordering 으로 surface 충돌 회피.
- Q: 신규 섹션 위치? A: § ② 뒤 / § ⑥ 앞 범위 안에서 § ② 종료 직후 (§ ③ 시작 직전). reader 가 어제 carryover 를 본 후 sector/지표/종목을 읽도록 reading order 유지. AC#4 만족.
- Q: event_type 닫힌 셋 크기? A: 6 (earnings/fed/geopolitics/macro/disclosure/other). 7번째 등장 시 별 unit 격상. terminology carryover (DGS10/UST/FRED) 는 본 unit 아닌 u40 확장.
- Q: walk-back 일수? A: default N=3 영업일 (env `INVESTO_CARRYOVER_LOOKBACK_DAYS` clamp `[1, 7]`). u34 의 N=5 와 별 surface (u34 = narrative 5일, u52 = structured event 3일). 사용자 회고가 "어제→오늘" 연쇄가 핵심이라 3일이 적정.
- Q: substring 매치 정밀도? A: ASCII ticker 는 `\b` word-boundary + uppercase preservation; 한국어 토픽 은 substring + ≥4 char. DEBT-D52-A 후보 (precision 부족 시).
- Q: 파서 견고성 (정규식 vs markdown-tree)? A: MVP = 정규식 + § heading 텍스트 anchor (신규 dep 회피). u51 (병렬 작성 중) 의 segmented-format 변경이 § ⑥ heading 텍스트를 바꾸면 본 unit Step 2 re-plan 필요. DEBT-D52-C 후보 (markdown-tree 전환).
- Q: u51 충돌 risk 어떻게 mitigate? A: u51 plan 확정 시점에 본 unit Step 2 영향 분석 1회 (planner 가 알람). 충돌 시 implementation 직전 re-plan.

**DEBT cross-references**:
- 본 plan 은 신규 DEBT 등록 없음. Open Questions 에 향후 DEBT 후보 명시:
  - D52-A: substring 매치 정밀도 (ticker false-positive).
  - D52-B: event_type 셋 확장 (ESG / regulation).
  - D52-C: markdown-tree 파서 전환 (u51 충돌 시).
- DEBT-060 (resolved by u35): chokepoint 6번째 consumer 등장 — `briefing/extract.py` 의 4 함수 재사용 강제. 신규 파일에 prefix literal 재선언 0건이 `tests/unit/briefing/test_extract_no_redeclare.py` grep guard 로 enforce.

**Source**: 2026-05-13 사용자 evaluation 직접. 진단의 5 결함은 사용자가 archive 4 파일 (05-06/05-07/05-08/05-11) 을 직접 비교 후 작성한 task brief 인용. 사용자 통찰 ("standalone preview 처럼 읽힘") 이 본 unit 의 핵심 디자인 결정 (구조화 표 + deterministic post-process) 에 직접 매핑.

- `aidlc-docs/audit.md` (this entry, prepended at top per newest-first convention)

**Status**: Planning complete; implementation deferred. 외부 의존 없음 (archive markdown 만 source — 신규 API 호출 없음). 의존 그래프: u34 + u35 + u29(DEBT-060) 모두 이미 landed → 본 unit 즉시 실행 가능. u51 (병렬 작성 중) 충돌 risk 는 Open Questions 에 명시 — u51 plan 확정 시 Step 2 영향 분석 필수.

**Context**: 본 unit 은 Wave 7 의 첫 단위 (Wave 6 u45..u50 종료 후 u51 + u52 가 새 wave 첫 두 unit). u51 은 별 surface (이름 미확정, 병렬 작성). u52 는 사용자 evaluation 의 5 결함 중 4 개 (carryover discipline) 를 cover; 5번째 (용어 메모리) 는 u40 확장 대상.

## Construction — u45..u50 — 5 New Units Planned (Wave 6, 2026-05-09 Cron US-Equity Quality Retrospective)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-10T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 2026-05-09 cron 미국 시황 (`archive/us-equity/2026/05/2026-05-08.md`) 발행 후 사용자 quality 회고. 3 가지 결함 적시 — (1) BTC/ETH 얘기가 너무 많음 (us-equity 시황인데 ②/③/⑤/⑥ 4개 섹션이 크립토 narrative 로 지배), (2) 어제 미국 지수가 사상 최고가 경신했는데 시황에 안 나옴, (3) 전반적으로 "중심 없는" 느낌. 메인 세션 진단으로 (A) `briefing/segments.py` dual-routing 버그 (P0, `if/if/if` NOT `elif`), (B) yfinance HTTP 429 IP-level block (P0, GHA shared runner), (C) yahoo-finance-news 개인금융 노이즈 (P1), (D) ATH 같은 결정론적 narrative 부재 (사용자 통찰: 가격/차트 데이터만으로 도출 가능), (E) TradingView Lightweight Charts 자원 활용 가능 (사용자 자원) 으로 세분화.
**Decision**: Wave 6 로 5 신규 code-generation plan 작성 (u45..u50; u48 번호 의도적 skip — Wave 5 의 u48 자리는 reserved 였으나 사용 안 됨, 번호 재사용 회피로 u49/u50 부여). `aidlc-state.md` per-unit progress rows + 본 audit 항목 추가. **No code written** — planning-only delivery.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) yfinance 429 fix 만 단일 unit 으로 처리.** 거부됨 — IP-level rate-limit 은 코드 fix 로 우회 불가. 소스 교체가 정답이며, 그 자체로 별 unit 가치.
- **(b) 5 unit 분할 (u45 routing / u46 stooq / u47 noise / u49 anchor / u50 chart).** 채택. 각 unit 의 의존 그래프가 깔끔히 layered (u45 → u46 → u49 → u50; u47 독립); 단일 mega-unit 으로 묶으면 R10 fixture 작업 (u46 live recording) + 결정론 anchor 의 history source 결정 (u49 Open Question) 이 한 PR 안에 섞여 review 어려움.
- **(c) Stage 2 prompt 룰 만으로 노이즈/anchor 처리.** 거부됨 — 사용자 회고가 명시한 "결정론" 통찰의 핵심은 LLM 환각 risk 제거. prompt-only 접근은 환각 risk 가 남음 (예: ATH 가 아닌데 ATH 라고 인용). 결정론 모듈 (`market_anchor.py`) + prompt 룰 결합이 정답.
- **(d) BTC/ETH narrative 균형을 Stage 2 prompt 룰 (per-segment dominance cap) 로 강제.** 거부됨 (잠정) — 진단상 dominance 의 root cause 는 입력 라우팅 (us-equity 에 크립토 item 이 흘러들어옴) 이지 LLM 의 narrative 선택 편향이 아님. u45 routing fix 만으로 입력 dominance 가 사라지면 prompt 변경 불필요. 그래도 재발 시 별 unit 으로 격상 가능 — 본 plan 의 Out of scope 에 명시.

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: u45 의 "강한 crypto signal" 정의 — 어디까지 좁힐 것인가? A: title prefix regex (`^(bitcoin|ethereum|btc|eth|crypto|stablecoin|defi)\b`) + `\bBTC\b`/`\bETH\b` ASCII word-boundary ticker + 명시적 phrase (`bitcoin price`, `ethereum price`) 3가지 조건. 하나라도 매치 시 us-equity 단독 source item 을 *crypto 로 이동* (복제 아님). 본문에 "BTC dropped" 한 줄 있다고 us-equity 에서 빠지지 않게 — title 신호 우선.
- Q: u46 yfinance 어댑터 제거할 것인가? A: 제거하지 않고 보존. 가끔 working day 가 있으므로 union (Stooq + yfinance 둘 다 등록) 으로 두면 source coverage confidence 가 더 높음. 일정 기간 (예: 3개월) 0건이 지속되면 별 cleanup unit 에서 제거 검토 — DEBT 후보.
- Q: u47 deny 패턴의 false-positive risk? A: `personal finance` 단독 패턴이 가장 광범위; "Personal Finance Q1 earnings" 같은 시장 헤드라인 매치 가능성. fixture 5 정상 케이스로 검증 + false-positive 발견 시 패턴 좁힘 (`personal finance tip`, `personal finance advice`).
- Q: u49 의 가격 history source — Option A (`archive/_meta/price_history.jsonl` 누적) vs Option B (Stooq multi-row fetch)? A: 권장 = Option B (Stooq multi-row 즉시 calculable). Option A 는 fallback (Stooq fail 시); Hybrid (B primary + A fallback) 가능. Step 1 첫 결정 사항으로 plan 의 Open Question 에 명시.
- Q: u49 의 anchor 라인 위치 — u25 watermark 바로 아래 vs 시황 ① 요약 안? A: 권장 = watermark 바로 아래 (헤더 영역에 모두 모임). UI 확정은 implementation 시점 mkdocs serve 비교.
- Q: u50 의 라이브러리 선택 — Lightweight Charts vs Charting Library full version? A: MVP = Lightweight Charts (MIT, ~60KB UMD bundle, 자가 호스팅). Charting Library full version 은 non-commercial 등록 필요 + 더 무거움. 사용자가 full version 을 원하면 별 unit 격상.
- Q: u50 의 데이터 source — TradingView UDF/REST 유료 API? A: 안 씀. 데이터는 Stooq (u46) 에서 우리 측이 fetch → `data-history` HTML attribute 주입. 무료 only 룰 보존.
- Q: u48 번호는 왜 비어있는가? A: Wave 5 (u37..u44) 종료 후 Wave 6 가 새 번호 할당. u48 자리는 의도적 skip — 향후 별도 단일 unit 이 등장하면 재사용 가능 (현 시점 reserved).

**DEBT cross-references**:
- 본 wave 는 새로운 DEBT 항목 등록 없음. 단 Open Questions 에 향후 DEBT 후보 명시:
  - u45: 한국어 크립토 prefix 룰 확장 (한경코인 등 한국어 크립토 source 추가 시).
  - u46: yfinance 어댑터 일정 기간 0건 지속 시 cleanup.
  - u47: deny 패턴 stale 화 — quarterly review 룰 또는 자동 카나리.
  - u49: history JSONL 압축 (1년 누적 시 ~600KB).
  - u50: 차트 init JS 의 `MutationObserver` cleanup / page-change 시 차트 re-init 룰.
- u32 `numeric_self_check`: u49 anchor 가 자동으로 verified haystack 에 포함됨 (anchor 수치는 입력 candidate 의 `raw_metadata` 에서 도출되므로 자연스럽게 매치). Anti-regression test pinned in u49 plan.

**Source**: 2026-05-09 cron 미국 시황 quality 회고 (사용자 직접). 진단은 메인 세션이 trace footer (`archive/us-equity/2026/05/2026-05-08.md` 의 ⑦ 섹션) + GHA log 분석 + `src/investo/briefing/segments.py:259-394` 코드 리뷰로 codify. 사용자 통찰 ("꼭 헤드라인 없어도 가격/차트 데이터만으로 ATH 경신 같은 건 결정론적으로 도출 가능") 이 u49 의 핵심 디자인 결정에 직접 인용됨.

**Status**: Planning complete; implementation deferred. u46 의 R10 fixture 녹화는 unauth public CSV 라 즉시 가능 (credential 블로커 없음); 나머지 4 unit 은 외부 의존 없음. 의존 그래프: u45 → u46 → u49 → u50; u47 독립.

**Context**: Wave 6 closes the 2026-05-09 cron US-equity quality 회고 surface. 사용자가 적시한 3 결함 (BTC/ETH dominance / ATH 누락 / 중심 없음) 은 (a) 라우팅 버그 (u45) + (b) 가격 source 가용성 (u46) + (c) 노이즈 (u47) + (d) 결정론적 anchor 부재 (u49) + (e) visual 보강 (u50) 의 layered cause 로 분해됨. 모든 plan 의 "Persona evidence" 섹션이 사용자 회고 직접 인용 + trace footer 의 leak item ID 인용 (Item #54 / #76 / #82). Plans 250-450 줄 범위 (u47 ~145 / u45 ~210 / u46 ~210 / u49 ~250 / u50 ~270) — u47 은 가장 작은 변경 surface 라 짧음. 모든 plan 이 R10 / R13 / 모듈 경계 / 무료 API only / Anthropic SDK ban 룰을 명시적으로 enforce.

## Construction — u37..u44 — 8 New Units Planned (Wave 5, 10-Persona Evaluation)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: 10-persona end-user evaluation completed in main session 2026-05-09. Eight backlog candidates surfaced; user explicitly excluded the 9th candidate (persona #3 / 크립토 트레이더 24/7 발행 주기 분리) from this wave.
**Decision**: Author 8 new code-generation plan files (u37..u44), corresponding `aidlc-state.md` per-unit progress rows, and this audit entry. **No code written** — planning-only delivery.

**Options compared**:
- **(a) Land 9 units including the persona #3 (크립토 트레이더) 24/7 발행 주기 분리 follow-up.** Rejected — user explicitly opted to defer item #3 (cited reason: 운영비 / GHA minutes 영향 평가 후 추후 별도 검토). Including it now would force an early commitment on segment-publish frequency that no other persona requires.
- **(b) Land 8 units (u37..u44) as enumerated.** Accepted — covers personas #1, #2, #4, #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 (8 of 10 personas) plus DEBT-058 + DEBT-067 backlog closures. Persona #3 follow-up remains a pending evaluation item, not yet a unit.

**Design Q/A**:
- Q: Should u41 (DART) and u43 (lookahead adapters) ship together since both are blocked on live-API fixture sessions? A: No — they remain separate units with distinct provenance (DART = persona #5 국내 surface; lookahead = personas #4 + #8 + DEBT-067). Bundling would obscure the persona attribution and force a single fixture-recording session to cover endpoints with different upstream stability profiles.
- Q: u44 retrospective + accuracy tracker as one unit or two? A: One unit, 6-step plan with explicit Step 1-3 (retrospective) / Step 4-6 (accuracy) split so the surfaces can land in independent PRs if scope pressure emerges. Both share the `archive/_meta/` time-series infrastructure (forecast_log.jsonl + quality_history.jsonl reuse the same atomic-write convention from u31), so combining at the planning level avoids duplicate "JSONL append" infrastructure decisions. Per the user's note "단, 6 step plan 으로 명시 분리 권장."
- Q: u38 (PNG twin) — cairosvg vs rsvg-convert path? A: Plan recommends cairosvg (option a) so the conversion is testable locally via `mkdocs serve` and not coupled to GHA infra; option b kept as fallback if cairosvg install proves brittle on the runner.
- Q: u39 (boot-alert dispatch) module-boundary scope? A: `__main__` may import only `notifier.OperatorAlerter` and `orchestrator/boot_alert_dedup` (the existing u31 ledger). No new imports from `briefing/`, `publisher/`, or `sources/`. This invariant is plan-pinned + must be enforced by the developer agent at code-review time.
- Q: u41 + u43 R10 fixture posture? A: Both units are explicitly **blocked** on live-API fixture sessions per R10 (no fabricated payloads). The plan's "Open questions" section documents the credential / session prerequisites: `OPENDART_API_KEY` (u41), `FRED_API_KEY` + 4-endpoint live access (u43). The `aidlc-state.md` row for each carries an explicit "블로킹: ... 대기" note.

**DEBT cross-references**:
- u38 plan DoD includes "Move DEBT-058 to Resolved Items" + 결과 적용 시점 표기.
- u43 plan DoD includes "Move DEBT-067 to Resolved Items" (with possible sub-bullet retention if `krx-option-expiry` defers).
- u41 plan adds `DOMESTIC_DISCLOSURE_QUIET` to u22 reason-code enum; u43 plan adds `LOOKAHEAD_DATA_MISSING` per DEBT-067 sub-bullets M1 + M3.

**Source**: 10-persona evaluation conducted in main session 2026-05-09. User direct decision to land 8 units (excluding item #3). No external evidence; this entry codifies the user-confirmed scope.

**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u37-watchlist-default-bundle-code-generation-plan.md` (new)
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u38-og-card-png-twin-code-generation-plan.md` (new)

- `aidlc-docs/audit.md` (this entry, prepended at top per newest-first convention)

**Status**: Planning complete; implementation deferred. u41 and u43 specifically blocked on live-API credential / fixture sessions per R10. Other 6 units (u37, u38, u39, u40, u42, u44) have no external blockers and may be picked up by `investo-developer` in any order driven by ROI prioritization.

**Context**: Wave 5 closes the 10-persona evaluation surface backlog into actionable code-generation plans. Provenance is intact: every unit's "Persona evidence" section carries direct quotes from the persona evaluation, every plan declares its DoD / Steps / quality gate / out-of-scope / open-questions consistently with the existing u30..u36 plan format. Plans are sized 250-450 lines each per user request; per-unit progress rows include explicit dependency + persona attribution + estimated effort metadata for downstream prioritization.

## Cross-Check — u33 watchlist-depth — COMPLETE
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u33 Code Generation closed (Steps 1–6 all closed in this session). All six DoD items verified complete; two DoD sub-clauses (average-cost portfolio metadata, email channel) intentionally omitted per scope rules.
**Scope**: u33 watchlist-depth mapped to FR-003, FR-004, FR-007, NFR-002, NFR-003, NFR-004, NFR-005, NFR-006, NFR-007.
**Result**: PASS — 6/6 DoD items complete; +36 targeted tests (1450 → 1486); no new TECH-DEBT items; no DEBT-* resolved.
**Evidence**:
- Cross-check report: `docs/cross-checks/2026-05-09-u33-watchlist-depth.md`
- Unit summary: `aidlc-docs/construction/u33-watchlist-depth/code/summary.md`
- New source files: `src/investo/notifier/webhooks.py`, `src/investo/publisher/watchlist_pages.py`, `src/investo/visuals/watchlist_chart.py`.
- Modified source files: `src/investo/briefing/watchlist.py` (`WatchlistScope` model + `WatchlistConfig.weights` + `WatchlistConfig.scopes` + `WatchlistMatch.weight` + sort comparator + `for_segment_scope` + `render_watchlist_impact(now_utc=)` + `_watchlist_d_suffix`), `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py` (`_stage_publish_segments(items=)` + watchlist page snapshot/rollback hook), `src/investo/__main__.py` (webhook fan-out post-publish).
- New test files: `tests/unit/briefing/test_watchlist_u33.py` (12), `tests/unit/notifier/test_webhooks.py` (10), `tests/unit/publisher/test_watchlist_pages.py` (7), `tests/unit/visuals/test_watchlist_chart.py` (7).
- Tests: +36 (1450 → 1486); covers weight sort (asc/desc/tie-break/negative-rejection), lookahead D-N suffix (4 branches: present/missing-now_utc/past/far-future), per-ticker accumulation page (first-write/idempotent-replace/multi-day-preservation/index-listing/weight-render-on/off/Korean-term), multi-watchlist scopes (no-scopes-pass-through/segment-binding/cross-segment-skip/unbound-applies-all/scope-weight-override), webhook routing (env-parser unset/invalid-json/known-channels/unknown-dropped/missing-url-dropped + Slack/Discord shapes + 4xx swallow + empty-text skip), cumulative chart (empty/sort/tie/cap/determinism/escape/self-contained).
- Verification: `uv run ruff check .` ✅, `uv run ruff format --check .` ✅ (226 files), `uv run mypy --strict src/` ✅ (90 source files), `uv run pytest -q` ✅ (1486 passed), `uv run mkdocs build --strict` ✅.
- TECH-DEBT delta: none.
**Status**: u33 construction and cross-check complete. Wave 3 wish-list (persona #4) surface fully landed.

## Construction — u33 watchlist-depth — Steps 1-6 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Closed all six u33 steps in one session. **Step 1** — `WatchlistConfig.weights` (canonical-uppercase ASCII keys; rejects negatives at validation; defaults to 0.0); `WatchlistMatch.weight` carried through; `match_watchlist_items` sorts by `(-weight, term, source, title)` so high-conviction positions surface first. Average-cost field intentionally omitted (out of scope: project does not carry portfolio / accounting state). **Step 2** — `render_watchlist_impact(now_utc=)` + `_watchlist_d_suffix` append " D-N" when the match item carries a `scheduled_at` within 7 days; reuses u35's `NormalizedItem.scheduled_at` plumbing — no new adapters. **Step 3** — `publisher/watchlist_pages.py::update_watchlist_pages` writes one `site_docs/watchlist/{slug}.md` per term with per-day `<!-- u33 entry YYYY-MM-DD begin/end -->` markers (idempotent on re-run); slug rule preserves ASCII upper / Korean syllables / bracketed numeric tickers; each page also gets a per-day section heading and bulleted source/kind/title lines (with optional weight). The regenerated `site_docs/watchlist/index.md` lists every term page (with cumulative match count) and embeds the Step 5 SVG chart at the top. Orchestrator `_stage_publish_segments` accepts `items=` and threads them through to `update_watchlist_pages` after the per-segment archive write; snapshots the rewritten files for atomic rollback. **Step 4** — `WatchlistScope` model carries its own term lists / `weights` overrides / `segments` binding; `WatchlistConfig.scopes: dict[str, WatchlistScope]` + `for_segment_scope(segment)` returns a flattened config merging the root + every applicable scope (scope-level weights override root weights for the same term). `notifier/webhooks.py::WebhookEndpoint(channel='slack' | 'discord', url)`; `load_webhook_endpoints(raw=None)` parses `INVESTO_WATCHLIST_WEBHOOKS` (JSON list); `dispatch_watchlist_alert(text, *, http, endpoints)` fans out best-effort (Slack `{"text": ...}`, Discord `{"content": ...}`; 4xx / 5xx / connection error logged at WARNING + swallowed). `__main__` broadcasts a one-line `Investo daily briefing — YYYY-MM-DD published\n{briefing_url}` to every configured webhook after a non-FAILED, non-dry-run pipeline returns. Email channel intentionally skipped (no free, account-less SMTP relay). **Step 5** — `visuals/watchlist_chart.render_cumulative_match_chart(counts_by_term)` deterministic SVG (sort by count desc → term alphabetical; cap 8 visible bars; remainder collapses into `기타 N건`; empty mapping → friendly placeholder). Pure: same input → byte-identical SVG. **Step 6** — full quality gate.
**Status**: Code Generation complete (6/6 steps); full quality gate green: `ruff check` ✅, `ruff format --check` ✅ (226 files), `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (90 source files), `pytest -q` ✅ 1486 passed (1450 → 1486, +36 new tests), `mkdocs build --strict` ✅.
**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u33-watchlist-depth-code-generation-plan.md`
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u33-watchlist-depth/code/summary.md` (new)

- `aidlc-docs/audit.md` (this entry + cross-check entry above)
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (per-unit row u33 Planned → Complete; Code Generation Notes appended)
**Context**: Wave 3 wish-list (persona #4) surface — long-horizon trackers. Six orthogonal watchlist signals layered on top of u28's onboarding-friendly baseline: weight-sorted callouts, forward-event D-N suffix, per-term accumulation page, multi-segment scoping, free-tier multi-channel routing, cumulative SVG chart. The orchestrator now writes 5 reader surfaces per publish (segment archive markdown + visual SVGs + index pages + quality dashboard + watchlist accumulation pages) under one atomic snapshot/rollback envelope.

## Cross-Check — u32 trust-traceability-deep-dive — COMPLETE
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u32 Code Generation closed (Steps 1–5 all closed in this session). All five DoD items verified complete; one DoD sub-clause (operator-alert escalation on numeric mismatch) intentionally landed at the brief-header callout level rather than a separate operator alert path — the brief header is the read surface readers and operators already consume.
**Scope**: u32 trust-traceability-deep-dive mapped to FR-001, FR-003, NFR-002, NFR-003, NFR-004, NFR-005, NFR-006, NFR-007.
**Result**: PASS — 5/5 DoD items complete; +31 targeted tests (1419 → 1450); no new TECH-DEBT items; no DEBT-* resolved.
**Evidence**:
- Cross-check report: `docs/cross-checks/2026-05-09-u32-trust-traceability-deep-dive.md`

## Construction — u32 trust-traceability-deep-dive — Steps 1-5 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Closed all five u32 steps in one session. **Step 1** — `SourceTier = Literal["S","A","B","C"]` lives in `models/coverage.py` and is carried by `SourceOutcome.tier`. New `sources/tiers.py` registry maps every adapter to a tier (S = SEC EDGAR / FOMC RSS / KRX / Treasury / FSC / Korea policy RSS; A = yfinance / Binance / FRED / nasdaq earnings / yahoo finance news / nasdaq stocks news / US economic calendar; B = CNBC / Yonhap / The Block / CoinGecko / DefiLlama). Aggregator stamps tier at collection time; `SegmentCoverage.tier_mix_label` renders deterministic `S=2 / A=1 / B=4`-style label. `_render_coverage_badge` adds a "소스 등급 분포" line when non-empty. GHA Step Summary table grows a Tier column. Unknown adapters log INFO + fall back to `"B"` so registry gaps stay visible without flooding operator triage. **Step 2** — `briefing/numeric_self_check.py` extracts flaggable numeric tokens (decimal / thousands-separator / unit-bearing / ≥4-digit) from Stage 2 output and cross-checks against a haystack of numeric substrings present in any Stage 1 candidate's title / summary / raw_metadata. Mismatches render a brief-header callout `> **수치 검증 경고**: 입력에서 확인되지 않은 수치 — ... 외` (capped at 5 tokens). `_enhance_reader_experience(candidates=)` threads through both the data-limited and the LLM-output paths. Operator-alert escalation deferred (the brief-header callout is the read surface). **Step 3** — `briefing/trace_footer.py` computes three sha256 12-char prefixes — `input_hash` (Stage 1 candidate JSON), `stage1_hash` (parsed `ClassificationResult.model_dump()`), `stage2_hash` (raw Stage 2 body) — and renders a `<details>`-collapsed footer with the three hashes plus a per-item table (id / source / category / section / 60-char-truncated title). The footer is appended to `enhanced_markdown` immediately before the disclaimer is added so it lands inside every published archive entry. **Step 4** — `briefing/quality_eval.py` computes three trailing-7-day KPIs (source liveness, figures presence, fallback ratio) over the u31 `coverage.jsonl` time series and the archive directory; `render_quality_page` produces a Korean Markdown body for `site_docs/quality.md`. `publisher/site_index.update_quality_page` writes the page atomically; orchestrator `_stage_publish_segments` snapshots the quality page first, regenerates it via `update_quality_page`, and appends the path to `index_paths` so it is committed alongside the briefing. mkdocs nav adds "데이터 품질" entry; bootstrap stub `site_docs/quality.md` ships so the first `mkdocs build --strict` passes. **Step 5** — full quality gate.
**Status**: Code Generation complete (5/5 steps); full quality gate green: `ruff check` ✅, `ruff format --check` ✅ (218 files), `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (87 source files), `pytest -q` ✅ 1450 passed (1419 → 1450, +31 new tests), `mkdocs build --strict` ✅.

**Context**: Wave 3 wish-list (persona #3) surface — critical-analyst day-by-day verification. The new tier registry, numeric self-check, traceability footer, hashed signatures, and public quality dashboard layer five orthogonal trust signals on top of the existing producer-side gates without modifying any of u22's coverage transparency, u25's summary fidelity, or u26's visual delivery contracts.

## Construction — u31 operations-resilience — Steps 1-5 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Closed all five u31 steps in one session. **Step 1** — `PipelineResult.source_outcomes` carries per-adapter outcomes through the result; `__main__._write_github_step_summary` renders a sorted Markdown source table (failed → zero → ok) so a failed adapter is visible at a glance during morning triage. `notifier/_telegram.send_message` adopts a bounded retry loop (1s → 2s exponential backoff, max 3 attempts) honouring HTTP `Retry-After` and JSON `parameters.retry_after` with a 30s ceiling; non-transient 4xx and `ok: false` API responses do not retry. **Step 2** — `orchestrator/boot_alert_dedup.py` JSON ledger persists `(error_type, sha256(message[:1024]))` fingerprints with a 14-day window; auto-prunes on read; corrupt ledger does not block alerting. `__main__._attempt_boot_alert` consults the ledger before constructing the alert and records on successful delivery. `BriefingPublisher(dry_run=)`, `OperatorAlerter(dry_run=)`, `commit_and_push(dry_run=)` short-circuit network/git I/O while leaving the working tree dirty for inspection. `__main__` reads `INVESTO_DRY_RUN` once at boot; orchestrator's `_is_dry_run()` re-reads per publish-stage entry so a caller flipping the flag mid-run is honoured. **Step 3** — `orchestrator/source_health.py` appends one JSON line per run to `archive/_meta/coverage.jsonl`; `detect_consecutive_failed(today, threshold=3)` walks the trailing N days with intersection semantics (gaps and ok/zero days reset). The orchestrator hook in `run_pipeline` writes the line and emits a soft `_safe_alert(stage="orchestrator", ...)` listing N-day-failed adapters; wrapped in best-effort try/except. **Step 4** — `orchestrator/weekly_ops_digest.py` renders a Korean Markdown block over the trailing 7 days (observed runs / failure-runs / success rate / top-5 failed / optional GHA minutes). `INVESTO_WEEKLY_OPS_DIGEST=1` opt-in arm on the Saturday 09:00 KST cron triggers dispatch via `notifier/_telegram.send_message` directly to the operator chat. Dry-run skips the dispatch with a log line. **Step 5** — `_internal/retry_budget.py` process-singleton counter (default 30; env override `INVESTO_RETRY_BUDGET`); the Telegram retry loop respects the global budget. Module-boundary intact: `_internal/` placement lets the notifier consume it without violating the orchestrator-only-imports rule.
**Status**: Code Generation complete (5/5 steps); full quality gate green: `ruff check` ✅, `ruff format --check` ✅ (211 files), `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (83 source files), `pytest -q` ✅ 1419 passed (1383 → 1419, +36 new tests), `mkdocs build --strict` ✅.

The five new env vars (`INVESTO_DRY_RUN`, `INVESTO_OPERATOR_STATE_DIR`, `INVESTO_COVERAGE_LOG_PATH`, `INVESTO_WEEKLY_OPS_DIGEST`, `INVESTO_RETRY_BUDGET`) all follow the project's `INVESTO_<SCOPE>_<NOUN>` convention and carry safe defaults. `_internal/retry_budget.py` placement preserves the notifier↔orchestrator module-boundary invariant.

## Construction — u30 telegram-first-impression — Steps 2-5 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-09T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Closed the remaining four u30 steps in one session. **Step 2** — segment collapse + per-channel toggle. `notifier/summary.py::build_segmented_summary` now accepts `coverage_by_segment` and collapses each `status == "insufficient"` segment to a single line `🇰🇷 *국내 증시* [부족] · [상세보기](url)`. The new `enabled_segments` kwarg + `resolve_enabled_segments` env-var helper (`INVESTO_TELEGRAM_ENABLED_SEGMENTS`, accepts canonical ids and short aliases) filter both body and footer; an empty resolved list falls back to all published segments so operator misconfiguration cannot produce a link-less alert. Orchestrator `_stage_notify_segmented_briefing` computes per-segment coverage from `routed.coverage_for_segment(...)` and reads the env var at notify time. **Step 3** — closed-set action tag contract. New module `briefing/action_tag.py` declares `[관망]` / `[변동성↑]` / `[강세]` / `[약세]` / `[혼조]` / `[데이터부족]` as the closed set; `apply_action_tag(conclusion, *, data_limited, section_text=None)` is a pure function whose resolution order is (1) force `[데이터부족]` when data_limited; (2) preserve trailing in-set tag verbatim; (3) strip off-set bracket token and replace with `[관망]`; (4) rescue an in-set tag from the raw section ① body when the sentence picker clipped at a Korean terminator (`다.`) before the tag; (5) append `[관망]`. `_build_summary_header` accepts `data_limited` and routes the conclusion through this helper from both the data-limited boilerplate body path and the LLM-output path. Stage 2 `STAGE2_SYSTEM` carries the strict tag contract and explicitly forbids the LLM from emitting `[데이터부족]` (publisher decides that branch). The notifier preserves the bracketed tag through `_clean_summary_text` because the markdown-link regex requires `[text](url)` shape (a bare `[강세]` is not stripped). **Step 4** — KST publish time + watchlist price suffix. `_publish_time_label(now_utc, target_date)` emits `🕐 KST HH:MM · 전 거래일: YYYY-MM-DD` between the title and snapshot rows; `now_utc` defaulting to `datetime.now(tz=UTC)` keeps the function callable without orchestrator threading while permitting deterministic test injection. `_build_watchlist_price_index` indexes price items by ticker / symbol / coin_id / index_name / asset_name (casefolded) with `BTCUSDT → BTC` ticker-prefix expansion. `_format_watchlist_suffix` prefers pct alone (`(+1.2%)`) — the actionable signal — and falls back to compact absolute price. `_decorate_watchlist_with_prices` parses the watchlist line at the `건 확인 — ` boundary, splits matches on `;`, and decorates each `TERM: TITLE` segment to `TERM(+1.2%): TITLE` when the index has a hit; misses leave the term unchanged (the safe ticker-only fallback). `_one_line_summary` accepts `watchlist_prices` and applies the decorator only when the watchlist text is non-empty and not a u28 site-only branch. **Step 5** — full quality gate.
**Status**: u30 Code Generation complete (5/5 steps); full quality gate green: `ruff check` ✅, `ruff format --check` ✅ (203 files), `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (79 source files), `pytest -q` ✅ 1383 passed (1308 → 1383, +75 new tests), `mkdocs build --strict` ✅.
**Affected docs**:

**Context**: Wave 2 P1 persona #1 surface — the morning Telegram alert is the surface most readers see exactly once. The four steps closed today layer four orthogonal information density wins (segment collapse · action tag · KST header · watchlist price) on top of Step 1's URL masking + market snapshot.

## Construction — u30 telegram-first-impression — Step 1 Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Completed Step 1 of u30 Code Generation. Telegram public-channel URLs now render as Markdown `[상세보기](url)` links in both single-briefing and segmented summaries, with the existing plain-text fallback still converting links back to readable `상세보기: url` text on Telegram Markdown parse errors. Segmented notification now accepts the already-collected price `NormalizedItem` rows from the orchestrator and renders a compact market snapshot line before segment blocks when representative data exists: `SPX`, `NDX`, `KOSPI`, and `BTC`; missing inputs are omitted rather than shown as placeholders.
**Status**: Step 1 complete; u30 plan checkboxes updated; `aidlc-state.md` moved u30 from Planned to In Progress (Step 1/5).
**Verification**: `uv run ruff check src/investo/notifier/summary.py src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py tests/unit/notifier/test_summary.py` passed; `uv run mypy --strict src/` passed (78 source files); `uv run pytest tests/unit/notifier/test_summary.py tests/unit/orchestrator/test_run_pipeline.py -q` passed (85 tests); `uv run mkdocs build --strict` passed.

## Construction — u35 event-lookahead — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Lifted each daily briefing from a backward-looking recap into forward-looking context by surfacing the upcoming week's and month's high-impact scheduled events inside the segment narrative — vertical slice from source adapter to LLM prompt to segment markdown to Telegram summary. Bundled scope: u35 also lands **Phase 0 — DEBT-060 통합** as a precondition before adding the fifth conclusion-extraction surface to a sixth. Phase 0 introduces `src/investo/briefing/extract.py` (`extract_conclusion`, `extract_key_drivers`, `extract_caution`, `extract_watermark`) plus public `CONCLUSION_PREFIX` / `DRIVER_PREFIX` / `CAUTION_PREFIX` / `WATERMARK_PREFIX` exports on `briefing/summary_quality.py`, and switches the 5 existing duplicated sites (`publisher/site_index.py`, `publisher/weekly_digest.py`, `visuals/og_card.py`, `visuals/assets.py`, `briefing/context.py`) to import the chokepoint helpers; the grep guard `tests/unit/briefing/test_extract.py::test_no_surface_redeclares_prefix_literal` fails fast the moment a sixth consumer redeclares any of the prefix literals locally — DEBT-060 moved to Resolved Items. Phase 1 — Event Lookahead (partial): `NormalizedItem.scheduled_at: datetime | None` (default `None`, backward-compat); `sources/_window.py::FetchWindow.lookahead(days)` builder (raises on `days <= 0`, preserves `target_date` anchoring + half-open membership); `nasdaq-earnings-calendar` extended to opt-in lookahead (`INVESTO_EARNINGS_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS`, clamp `[0, 14]`, per-day failure isolation); Stage 2 system prompt adds a "주요 일정" rules block (input-only citation / no arbitrary forecast / 이번 주·이번 달 framing); `briefing/pipeline.py` adds `_MAX_LLM_LOOKAHEAD_ITEMS = 12` sub-cap inside the u13 96-total / 24-per-source cap + `_render_lookahead_context_block` renderer + `{lookahead_context}` placeholder on `STAGE2_USER_TEMPLATE` with explicit empty-bucket Korean note ("예정된 주요 일정이 없습니다."); `notifier/summary.py::build_segmented_summary` accepts `lookahead_items_by_segment` + `now_utc` and prepends a deterministic `📊 NVDA 실적 D-2` / `📅 FOMC press release — Fe… D-2` tag for events inside the 72h horizon (top-1 by ascending `scheduled_at`, tiebreaker source then title; LLM never sees this tag; absence keeps line unchanged). Lookahead block lives on a separate ~300-char-per-segment budget (80-char title trim × 12-row sub-cap) so combined Stage 2 context per segment caps at ~800 chars when paired with the u34 ~500-char recent-context budget. **R10 honoured end-to-end**: 4 new lookahead-specific source adapters (`fomc-calendar`, `fred-economic-calendar`, `coingecko-events`, KRX option-expiry) require live-API access for fixture recording and are registered as DEBT-067 (P1); the orchestrator wire-through and `LOOKAHEAD_DATA_MISSING` reason code are registered as DEBT-067 sub-bullets so they land **with** the adapters that populate them, not before — landing them today would be dead code on the production critical path and would cause the new reason code to fire on every segment indefinitely, eroding the u22 coverage-trust contract. Pre-merge code fix: M2 strengthened the FOMC label substring pin in `test_imminent_tag_uses_fomc_label_for_calendar_source`. M1 (orchestrator wire-through clock-explicit contract — `now_utc=None` while `lookahead_items_by_segment` is supplied raises `ValueError`) + M3 (single-filter reuse) → DEBT-067 sub-bullets.
**Status**: Code Generation complete (Phase 0 fully + Phase 1 partial); full quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check` 187 files, `mypy --strict src/` 71 source files, `pytest -q` 1308 passed (1268 → 1308, +40 new tests), `mkdocs build --strict` passed).
**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u35-event-lookahead-code-generation-plan.md` (DoD + step checkboxes marked; partial / deferred items annotated with DEBT-067 cross-reference)

- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (Per-Unit row u35 ⏳ Planned → ✅ Complete with partial / DEBT-067 cross-ref; Code Generation Notes appended; Build and Test Notes appended)
**Context**: Wave 4 (사용자 직접 요청) 2/2. The user-visible Telegram imminent tag and the segment "주요 일정" block are dormant in production until any one of the four DEBT-067 adapters lands — Phase 0 + Phase 1 land every layer u35 itself owns end-to-end, so the moment a real lookahead bucket arrives the entire pipe lights up without further code change beyond the orchestrator wire-through. The bundled Phase 0 investment is load-bearing: u34 promoted DEBT-060 Medium → High specifically because u35 was the imminent sixth-consumer trigger; by lifting the 5 existing sites onto a chokepoint **before** introducing any further extraction surface, this unit eliminates the duplication risk at the same moment the surface count was about to grow. R10 (record/replay fixtures, no fabrication) is honoured by deferring the 4 fixture-blocked adapters rather than landing fabricated payloads.

## Construction — u34 recent-briefings-context — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Lifted each daily briefing from a single-shot report into a "today inside the weekly arc" narrative. New `src/investo/briefing/context.py` (~290 LOC) declares a frozen `RecentBriefingsContext` (pydantic v2 + slots, `extra="forbid"`) carrying per-segment per-day publish date, conclusion line, key driver line, watermark, and coverage status; `is_empty()` + `for_segment(...)` resolvers; business-day walk-back skipping Sat / Sun with a 21-day cap so unbounded gap windows cannot stall the loader. Conclusion / driver / watermark anchor extraction reuses the `_CONCLUSION_PREFIX` / `_DRIVER_PREFIX` / `_WATERMARK_PREFIX` shape already present in `publisher/site_index.py`, `publisher/weekly_digest.py`, `visuals/og_card.py`, and `visuals/assets.py` — registering `briefing/context.py` as the fifth consumer (DEBT-060 promotion trigger). Each extracted field is 50-char truncated and run through `redact_text(STRICT)` defensively even though the loader reads only post-publish archive markdown already gated through `verify_disclaimer` + `briefing.leak_guard.scan` + `summary_quality`. `briefing/prompts.py` adds a "Recent-briefings continuity rules" section to `STAGE2_SYSTEM` (continuity / no verbatim repetition / "큰 변화 없음" explicit / no extrapolation — extension of the u25 numeric integrity rule), a `{recent_context}` placeholder on `STAGE2_USER_TEMPLATE`, and a `format_recent_context_section` helper. `briefing/pipeline.py` extends the `generate_briefing` signature and adds `_render_recent_context_block` / `_render_recent_entry` helpers. `orchestrator/pipeline.py` adds `_load_recent_context_for_run` and extends the briefing Protocol so the orchestrator threads the loaded context into Stage 2 immediately before `generate_briefing`. The recent-context block lives on a separate ~500-char-per-segment-per-day budget (50 chars × 4 fields ≪ 500) so it cannot starve the u13 LLM input candidate cap (96 total / 24 per source). Configurable via `INVESTO_RECENT_CONTEXT_DAYS` (default 5, valid `[0, 10]`, `0` disables the feature for a clean A/B); M3 fix emits a warning log on non-numeric / negative / out-of-range values while keeping missing/blank silent. M2 fix adds 6 unit tests (4 branch + 2 shape pins) on `_render_recent_context_block` / `_render_recent_entry` to harden against future prompt-format drift. M1 → DEBT-060 promotion. Telegram summary, hero callout, visual cards, and Stage 1 classification are all unchanged.
**Status**: Code Generation complete; full quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict src/` 70 source files, `pytest -q` 1268 passed (1240 → 1268, +28 new tests), `mkdocs build --strict` passed).

**Context**: Wave 4 (사용자 직접 요청 — 2026-05-08 session). User requirement: "시황 생성 시 어느 정도의 맥락을 위해 최근 N일의 시황을 컨텍스트에서 알고 있는 상태로 작성하면 좋을 듯". Expected effect — brief narrative depth lifts from "one-shot daily report" to "today inside the weekly arc". Partially overlaps persona #2 (site explorer) and persona #3 (analyst) wish-list signals around continuity / consistency, but is registered as Wave 4 rather than slotted under an existing persona wave so the provenance stays clean. No new external dependency, no paid API, no module-boundary change. Numeric self-check (Stage 3) remains carried by u32 — u34 does not subsume that work. The DEBT-060 promotion is the load-bearing TECH-DEBT signal: the next conclusion-extraction surface (e.g., u35 event-lookahead "주요 일정" block, or a hypothetical Telegram digest) lands on a 5-site duplication that has been explicitly elevated to High priority — consolidating into a `briefing.summary_quality.CONCLUSION_PREFIX` public export plus a `briefing.extract` helper before any sixth consumer is added is now the recommended sequencing.

## Construction — u35 event-lookahead — Plan REGISTERED
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User direct request (2026-05-08 session): "어제/오늘일은 아니지만 이번주나 이번달 중요한 이벤트가 있으면 미리 파악해서 주요 일정을 시황에 포함하면 좋을듯. 그러기 위해서는 데이터소스부터 프롬프트 생성까지 전부 건드려야 할 듯. 일단 계획후 유닛 만들고 진행." Wave 4 (사용자 직접 요청 — 페르소나 평가 wave 와 분리; u34 와 동일 wave, u34 등록 직후 같은 흐름). Implementation begins after plan registration.
**Decision**: Open u35 as a new follow-up unit covering a forward-looking vertical slice from source adapters to LLM prompt to segment markdown to Telegram summary. Source layer extends `nasdaq-earnings-calendar` to opt-in next-7-day lookahead and adds free public adapters for FOMC / FRB calendar (Federal Reserve RSS or ICS), US macro releases (FRED / Treasury / BLS public release-schedule feed), and crypto events (CoinGecko events public endpoint or equivalent) — KRX option-expiry / 공시 lookahead is registered as best-effort and downgraded to TECH-DEBT if no free feed is available. Model layer adds `NormalizedItem.scheduled_at: datetime | None` (None = backward-looking, default; preserves existing semantics). Aggregator runs a second lookahead pass per market timezone (KST / America/New_York / UTC per u8) producing forward windows aligned to `now`; both passes flow into u22 `SourceOutcome` records honestly. Stage 1 prompt gains a forward-looking sub-category contract; Stage 2 prompt adds a "주요 일정" section with three usage rules (input-only citation / no forecast / 이번 주·이번 달 framing) — extension of u25 numeric-integrity rule. Briefing pipeline applies a max-12-per-segment lookahead sub-cap inside the u13 96-total / 24-per-source LLM input cap so a high-volume earnings calendar cannot starve backward evidence. Segment markdown renders the lookahead block at a stable anchor (dedicated section or fenced sub-block under ⑥ 관전 포인트) without breaking the u15 coverage badge contract or the u20 archive trust contract. Telegram summary "오늘 한 줄" prepends a deterministic imminent-event tag (D-distance ≤ 72h, top-1 by deterministic ordering, e.g. `📅 FOMC D-2`, `📊 NVDA 실적 D-1`) — LLM is **not** asked to generate this tag; absence keeps the line unchanged. `SegmentCoverage.reason_codes` adds "주요 일정 데이터 부족" so missing FOMC / earnings / unlock feeds are visible to reader and operator. Per-segment lookahead block budget ~300 chars stays separate from u34 recent-context ~500-char-per-segment-per-day budget so segment context stays under ~800 chars/segment. R8 (`defusedxml` only) / R13 (secret hygiene via u27 redaction chokepoint) / R14 (SEC fair-access UA policy applied to all new adapters) preserved.
**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u35-event-lookahead-code-generation-plan.md` (created)
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (Per-Unit row added; Code Generation Notes appended)
- `aidlc-docs/audit.md` (this entry)
**Status**: Planned (⏳); Code Generation begins next.
**Context**: Vertical-slice unit — bigger surface than typical follow-ups because the user requirement spans data source through prompt through render through notifier. Aligned with persona #3 (analyst) and persona #4 (watchlist tracker) wish-list signals around "옵션·실적·배당락 캘린더 7-day 룩어헤드"; partial overlap with u33 watchlist depth (u33 = watchlist-specific lookahead, u35 = general segment lookahead) — kept as distinct units so provenance stays clean and u33 / u35 can ship independently. No new paid API, no module-boundary change (orchestrator → sources / briefing only). u34 recent-context (backward 5-day) and u35 event-lookahead (forward 7-day / 30-day) are complementary axes — combined Stage 2 context per segment caps at ~800 chars so the LLM still has headroom for the 96-candidate body.

## Construction — u34 recent-briefings-context — Plan REGISTERED
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User direct request (2026-05-08 session): "시황 생성 시 어느 정도의 맥락을 위해 최근 N일의 시황을 컨텍스트에서 알고 있는 상태로 작성하면 좋을 듯". Wave 4 (사용자 직접 요청 — 페르소나 평가 wave 와 분리). Implementation begins immediately after plan registration.
**Decision**: Open u34 as a new follow-up unit. Stage 2 will receive a frozen `RecentBriefingsContext` carrying the most recent N publish days (default 5 = 1 trading week) of segment archive entries — per-segment per-day publish date, conclusion line, key driver line, coverage status. Stage 1 classification is unchanged. Recent-context block lives on a separate ~500-char-per-segment-per-day budget so it cannot starve the u13 LLM input candidate cap (96 total / 24 per source). Loader reads only archive markdown already gated through `verify_disclaimer` + `briefing.leak_guard.scan` + `summary_quality`, so R8 / R13 are preserved without a re-scan of raw sources. Telegram summary, hero callout, and visual cards stay untouched — continuity / divergence is expressed inside the segment narrative only. Stage 2 prompt rules: (a) reference yesterday's continuity / divergence, (b) avoid repeating prior-day conclusions verbatim, (c) explicitly say "큰 변화 없음" when there is no new signal, (d) no extrapolation beyond the input data candidates (extension of u25 numeric integrity rule). Configurable via `INVESTO_RECENT_CONTEXT_DAYS` (default 5, valid `[0, 10]`, `0` disables the feature for a clean A/B); first publish / gap days return an empty context and the pipeline proceeds without raising.

## Construction — u29 site-discovery-v2 — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Reframed the public site so the first screen surfaces today's briefing content (not site-meta copy), and gave weekend retrospect readers a time-axis traversal layer. Added three deterministic SVG / publisher surfaces: `src/investo/visuals/calendar_heatmap.py` (publish-date × segment coverage color heatmap embedded in `archive/index.md`), `src/investo/visuals/og_card.py` (OG image renderer; SVG-only — PNG twin tracked under DEBT-058 — wired through `overrides/main.html` with absolute URL via the new `mkdocs.yml::site_url`), and `src/investo/publisher/weekly_digest.py` (`archive/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` with per-segment 5-day conclusion lists). Rewrote `src/investo/publisher/site_index.py` so `_render_hero_block` regenerates the `site_docs/index.md` hero from the latest segmented archive entries on every publish (no hardcoded "최신 묶음 YYYY-MM-DD"), `_render_segment_index` lists per-segment archive entries on `archive/{domestic-equity,us-equity,crypto,weekly}/index.md`, and per-publish OG meta emission flows through `overrides/main.html`. Split `site_docs/about.md` out of the home page so `site_docs/index.md` carries only the hero; added segment-prefixed nav (`Archive › 미국 증시 / 크립토 / 국내 증시`). `.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml` adds a Saturday 09:00 KST cron arm that sets `INVESTO_PUBLISH_WEEKLY=1` so `_stage_publish_segments` invokes `publish_weekly_digest` exactly once per week. Applied H1 (`mkdocs.yml` `site_url: https://murphygo.github.io/investo/` set so OG meta emits an absolute URL), H2 (`og_card.py` module docstring corrected — SVG OG is metadata / GH Pages preview only; social unfurl needs the DEBT-058 PNG twin), M1 (`_stage_publish_segments` validate / verify loop wrapped in try/except invoking `_rollback_paths(snapshots)` before re-raising `(SummaryQualityError, PublisherDisclaimerError, PublisherIOError)`), M2 (`publish_weekly_digest` now invokes `verify_disclaimer` before atomic write), and M3 (4 weekly-digest opt-in regression tests + `_patch_publish_segments_relative_paths` helper) pre-merge. M4 / M5 / TECH-DEBT P2 / TECH-DEBT P3 / L1-L4 / developer-self-discovered manifest-sidecar rollback gap deferred to DEBT-058 through DEBT-066.
**Status**: Code Generation complete; full quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check` 181 files, `mypy --strict src/` 69 source files, `pytest -q` 1240 passed, `mkdocs build --strict` passed; OG meta absolute URL verified at `https://murphygo.github.io/investo/assets/og-card.svg`).

**Context**: Wave 1 P0 follow-up from the 2026-05-07 persona evaluation (persona #2). u29 closes the persona #2 P0 + P1 + wish-list items in one unit by separating the site discovery problem into four concerns: (a) hero auto-refresh + About split (so the first viewport carries today's segment conclusions, not meta copy), (b) calendar heatmap + segment-prefixed nav (so retrospect readers can traverse the time axis), (c) weekly retrospective publish on the Saturday cron (so the weekend read has a 5-day digest), and (d) OG image meta (so external link previews carry the brand surface). The pre-merge fixes lift the unit from "ships but with disclaimer / rollback gaps" to "publish-grade": M1 hardens publish atomicity, M2 closes the disclaimer-gate gap on the new weekly publish path, H1 makes the OG meta crawl-correct on GH Pages. PNG twin (H2 / M5) is the most consequential deferral and is pinned at P1 priority (DEBT-058) for the next operations sweep.

## Cross-Check — u28 watchlist-usability-foundation — COMPLETE
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u28 Code Generation closed; QA verdict APPROVE_AFTER_FIXES with M3 (`_matches_term` signature gained `kind` parameter — short ≤ 2 ASCII ticker / asset terms match case-sensitive raw token, keyword / sector terms continue to use the casefold word-boundary regex) and M5 (`_matches_korean_term` defensive `if not term_cf: return False` entry guard) applied pre-merge. Health check after fixes landed.
**Scope**: u28 watchlist-usability-foundation mapped to FR-002, FR-003, FR-008, NFR-002, NFR-003, NFR-004, NFR-005, NFR-006, NFR-007.
**Result**: PASS — 6/6 Definition-of-Done items complete; no Critical/High findings; 7 new TECH-DEBT items registered (DEBT-051, DEBT-052, DEBT-053, DEBT-054, DEBT-055, DEBT-056, DEBT-057).
**Evidence**:
- Cross-check report: `docs/cross-checks/2026-05-08-u28-watchlist-usability-foundation.md`
- Unit summary: `aidlc-docs/construction/u28-watchlist-usability-foundation/code/summary.md`
- Implementation: `src/investo/briefing/watchlist.py` full refactor (`DEFAULT_CORE_ALIASES`, `WatchlistImpactStatus`, `WatchlistChannel`, `is_empty()`, `effective_aliases()`, `_matches_korean_term`, `_matches_short_ticker`, `_match_term_with_aliases`, `kind` parameter dispatch, `_SITE_MAX_RENDERED_MATCHES = 5`); `src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py` (channel + coverage_status thread); `src/investo/notifier/summary.py` (coverage_hold prefix strip + unconfigured skip); `src/investo/visuals/cards.py` (`WatchlistRelevanceCardInput.rows max_length=5` + slice); `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py` (visual-asset coverage_status thread).
- Default alias bundle: BTC / ETH / SOL + NVDA / TSLA / AAPL / MSFT / GOOGL / META / AMZN, each with English + Korean aliases. User-supplied `aliases` merged over defaults via `effective_aliases()`.
- Coverage hold branch: `insufficient` coverage flips watchlist status to `coverage_hold`; site renders the `데이터 수집 부족으로 매칭 판단 보류` callout, LLM Stage 2 prompt context carries the same status, visual card carries the same status, Telegram suffix is suppressed.
- Tests: +28 (1182 → 1210); new file `tests/unit/briefing/test_watchlist_pipeline_u28.py` (2 tests); `tests/unit/briefing/test_watchlist.py` extended +25 (alias resolution / Hangul boundary / short ticker case-sensitive / coverage_hold copy / site cap 5 / defensive empty-term guard); `tests/unit/visuals/test_cards.py` and `tests/unit/notifier/test_summary.py` updated for cap and coverage_hold branches.
- Verification: `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `mypy --strict src/` (66 source files), `pytest -q` (1210 passed); `mkdocs build --strict` to be re-verified at the u25-u33 wave close.
- New TECH-DEBT: DEBT-051 (Low — alias value cross-key collision validation absent), DEBT-052 (Low — `match_watchlist_items` `partial`/`normal` docstring absent), DEBT-053 (Low — site cap 5 hard-coded in 4 places), DEBT-054 (Low — `WatchlistImpact` invariant for coverage_hold / unconfigured not enforced), DEBT-055 (Low — `WatchlistChannel` branching distributed across 3 modules), DEBT-056 (Low — short ASCII ticker registration produces no config-load warning), DEBT-057 (Low — `WatchlistMatch.matched_alias` exposure semantics not documented).
**Status**: u28 construction and cross-check complete. Persona #4 P0 + P1 closed.

## Construction — u28 watchlist-usability-foundation — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Made the watchlist surface legible to first-time users (onboarding nudge), forgiving across Korean / English aliases, and disciplined under partial coverage. `briefing/watchlist.py` introduces `DEFAULT_CORE_ALIASES` (BTC / ETH / SOL + NVDA / TSLA / AAPL / MSFT / GOOGL / META / AMZN with English + Korean aliases), `WatchlistImpactStatus` (NORMAL / PARTIAL / COVERAGE_HOLD / UNCONFIGURED), `WatchlistChannel` (SITE / TELEGRAM), `WatchlistConfig.aliases` field, `is_empty()` + `effective_aliases()` resolvers, `_matches_korean_term` (Hangul particle / whitespace / punctuation word-boundary heuristic so `비트` no longer matches inside `비트맵`), `_matches_short_ticker` (≤ 2 ASCII ticker / asset = case-sensitive raw token; ≥ 3 ASCII = casefold word-boundary regex), `_match_term_with_aliases(..., kind)`, and `_SITE_MAX_RENDERED_MATCHES = 5`. `briefing/pipeline.py` threads `WatchlistChannel` and `coverage_status` into the watchlist call site so the coverage_hold branch flows through the segment markdown callout (`데이터 수집 부족으로 매칭 판단 보류`), the Stage 2 LLM prompt context, and the visual relevance card consistently. `notifier/summary.py` strips the coverage_hold prefix from the Telegram impact suffix and skips the suffix entirely when unconfigured. `visuals/cards.py` raises `WatchlistRelevanceCardInput.rows` `max_length` to 5 and updates the slice in `build_watchlist_relevance_card`. `orchestrator/pipeline.py` threads the coverage_status into the visual-asset builder. Applied M3 (`_matches_term` `kind` parameter — short ≤ 2 ASCII ticker / asset case-sensitive raw matching; keyword / sector casefold word-boundary regex consistent with longer terms) and M5 (`_matches_korean_term` defensive `if not term_cf: return False` entry guard) pre-merge. M1 / M2 / M4 / M6 / L1-L3 deferred to DEBT-051 through DEBT-057.
**Status**: Code Generation complete; quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict src/` 66 source files, `pytest -q` 1210 passed; 1182 → 1210, +28 new tests). `mkdocs build --strict` to be re-verified at the u25-u33 wave close.

## Cross-Check — u26 visual-delivery-integrity — COMPLETE
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: u26 Code Generation closed; QA verdict APPROVE_AFTER_FIXES with M2 (`_investo_version` SHA branch tightened with `^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$` regex) and M3 (docstring example chain corrected to match implementation order `__version__` → 7-hex SHA → `"dev"`) applied pre-merge. Health check after fixes landed.
**Scope**: u26 visual-delivery-integrity mapped to FR-002, FR-003, FR-008, NFR-002, NFR-003, NFR-004, NFR-005, NFR-006, NFR-007.
**Result**: PASS — 6/6 Definition-of-Done items complete; no Critical/High findings; 2 new TECH-DEBT items registered (DEBT-049, DEBT-050).
**Evidence**:
- Cross-check report: `docs/cross-checks/2026-05-08-u26-visual-delivery-integrity.md`
- Unit summary: `aidlc-docs/construction/u26-visual-delivery-integrity/code/summary.md`
- Regression diagnosis: the five 2026-05-06 missing-SVG archive entries are **not** a code defect. Visuals integration commit `e695bfb` (2026-05-08) landed *after* the four 2026-05-06 publish commits (`605744a`, `879cddf`, `9215b97`, `e3cc413`); at publish time the segmented path simply did not include `assets.insert_visual_links` yet. Diagnosed as a publish-time scheduling artefact, not a code regression.
- Implementation: `src/investo/visuals/render.py` (`_FONT_FAMILY` Noto Sans KR + Arial fallback; `_CARD_STYLE` `<style>` block + `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`; class hooks card-bg / card-frame / card-title / card-subtitle / card-label / card-emphasis / card-text / card-disclaimer), `src/investo/visuals/provenance.py` (`_investo_version` 3-tier fallback chain `__version__` → git short SHA → `"dev"` with M2 regex tightening + M3 docstring fix)
- Regression pin: `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_run_pipeline.py::test_run_pipeline_segmented_publish_inserts_visual_links_and_stages_svgs` (segmented publish runs `assets.insert_visual_links`; staged SVGs land in `<segment>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.assets/` next to the archive markdown; markdown carries `![](...)` references)
- New scripts: `scripts/backfill_2026_05_06_visuals.py` (one-shot curated patch — repairs truncated quote-block lines, renders 3 SVG cards × 3 segments with manifests, invokes production `insert_visual_links`)
- Backfill output: 3 archive markdown rewrites + 9 SVGs + 9 manifests across `archive/{domestic-equity,us-equity,crypto}/2026/05/2026-05-06.assets/`. All gates passed (`verify_disclaimer`, `summary_quality`, `briefing.leak_guard.scan`, `validate_visual_asset` dimensions in `[100, 2000]`).
- Tests: +10 (1172 → 1182); new tests in `tests/unit/visuals/test_render.py` (font-family + dark-mode `<style>` block + class hooks) and `tests/unit/visuals/test_provenance.py` (3-tier version fallback chain — 5 cases + auto-extended SHA test for `^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$` regex).
- Verification: `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .` (174 files), `mypy --strict src/` (66 source files), `pytest -q` (1182 passed), `mkdocs build --strict` (passed).
- New TECH-DEBT: DEBT-049 (Medium — SVG `<img>`-embedded `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` only sees OS-level scheme; mkdocs Material's `data-md-color-scheme="slate"` site toggle invisible to embedded SVG), DEBT-050 (Low — `scripts/backfill_2026_05_06_visuals.py` is single-use; retire or generalise around 2026-08).
**Status**: u26 construction and cross-check complete. Persona #2 P0 + P1 items closed.

## Construction — u26 visual-delivery-integrity — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Diagnosed and closed the post-u24 visual-delivery regression. Confirmed via commit-history analysis that the five 2026-05-06 segmented archive entries lacking embedded SVG cards are **not** a code defect — visuals integration commit `e695bfb` (2026-05-08) landed *after* the four 2026-05-06 publish commits (`605744a`, `879cddf`, `9215b97`, `e3cc413`), so at publish time the orchestrator's segmented publish path simply did not include `assets.insert_visual_links` yet. Added regression pin `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_run_pipeline.py::test_run_pipeline_segmented_publish_inserts_visual_links_and_stages_svgs` to guarantee future segmented runs always emit `![](...)` references and stage SVGs beside the markdown. Backfilled 2026-05-06 via one-shot curated `scripts/backfill_2026_05_06_visuals.py` (repairs truncated quote-block lines, renders 3 SVG cards × 3 segments with manifests, invokes production `insert_visual_links`); produced 3 archive markdown rewrites + 9 SVGs + 9 manifests, all gates passed. Standardised visual trust signals: `src/investo/visuals/render.py` now declares `font-family: "Noto Sans KR", Arial, sans-serif` via `_FONT_FAMILY` and a single `_CARD_STYLE` `<style>` block carrying class hooks (`card-bg / card-frame / card-title / card-subtitle / card-label / card-emphasis / card-text / card-disclaimer`) drives light + dark variants for both `DataConfidenceCard` and `WatchlistCard`. `src/investo/visuals/provenance.py::_investo_version` replaced the `"0"` sentinel with a 3-tier fallback chain `investo.__version__` → `git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD` (validated against `^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$`) → `"dev"`. Dark-mode option (a) chosen — single SVG with embedded `<style>` + `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Applied M2 (SHA branch regex tightening) + M3 (docstring example chain correction) pre-merge; M1 → DEBT-049, M4 → DEBT-050.
**Status**: Code Generation complete; quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check` 174 files, `mypy --strict src/` 66 source files, `pytest -q` 1182 passed, `mkdocs build --strict` passed).

- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`
**Context**: Wave 1 P0 follow-up from the 2026-05-07 persona evaluation (persona #2). u26 closes the missing-SVG-on-public-site P0 item by separating the "regression diagnosis" from the "trust-signal standardisation" work: the diagnosis showed no code defect, so the engineering value lands in (a) a regression pin that prevents recurrence, (b) a curated 2026-05-06 backfill that does not disturb already-public Stage 2 narrative content, and (c) the font / version / dark-mode polish persona #2 P1 also requested. QA verdict APPROVE_AFTER_FIXES; M2 (SHA regex tightening) + M3 (docstring example chain correction) applied pre-merge; M1 (mkdocs Material site-toggle vs OS-level dark-mode mismatch) deferred to DEBT-049; M4 (backfill script retirement) deferred to DEBT-050.

**Scope**: u25 summary-fidelity-and-content-trust mapped to FR-002, FR-003, FR-008, NFR-002, NFR-003, NFR-004, NFR-005, NFR-006, NFR-007.
**Result**: PASS — 6/6 Definition-of-Done items complete; no Critical/High findings; 3 new TECH-DEBT items registered (DEBT-046, DEBT-047, DEBT-048).

- New TECH-DEBT: DEBT-046 (Medium — `_SEGMENT_MARKET_TZ` single source-of-truth across briefing and sources), DEBT-047 (Medium — extract `is_unsafe_summary_value(str) -> bool` so producer ↔ gate share one helper), DEBT-048 (Low — `_NUMBER_DOT_ONLY_RE` proper subset of `_LIST_MARKER_ONLY_RE`).

## Construction — u25 summary-fidelity-and-content-trust — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Hardened first-viewport summary fidelity and added a deterministic timestamp watermark. `briefing/pipeline.py::_summary_sentence`, `_clean_summary_line`, and `_split_into_sentences` rewritten so producer rejects marker-only (`^\d+\.$`), list-marker-only, conjunction-tail (e.g. `^.*\bvs\.$`), and empty/whitespace candidates and falls back to the data-limited path. `briefing/summary_quality.py::_validate_summary_value` widened with the same 4-pattern reject set; producer ↔ gate contract documented in the module docstring. `_render_timestamp_watermark` produces a `**기준 시각**: YYYY-MM-DD KST [start_utc, end_utc)` line inserted by `_enhance_reader_experience` directly under each segment H1; `_SEGMENT_MARKET_TZ` / `_SEGMENT_MARKET_TZ_LABEL` mirror `sources/aggregator._window_for_adapter` (KST/America-NY/UTC) so the visible window matches the actual data-collection window. `briefing/prompts.py` Stage 2 system prompt forbids arithmetic over input figures and rewrites ⑤ section grouping labels neutrally (no "주도주" / "부진" / "주의" verbatim wording). Gate invocation path was already wired at `orchestrator/pipeline.py:497`; u25 only widened the reject set. Applied M3 (docstring example values 15:00Z/15:00Z) pre-merge. M1 → DEBT-046, M2 → DEBT-047, M4 → DEBT-048.
**Status**: Code Generation complete; quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict src/` 66 source files, `pytest -q` 1172 passed). `mkdocs build --strict` to be re-verified at the u25-u33 wave close.

## Construction — u27 secret-hygiene-unification-and-cost-guard — Code Generation Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Action**: Implemented secret-redaction chokepoint and OpenAI cost guard. Added `src/investo/_internal/redaction.py` carrying `SECRET_PATTERNS`, `SECRET_ENV_VARS` (6 names including `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `FRED_API_KEY`), and a `RedactionPolicy` enum (`STRICT` for diagnostic / coverage / provenance / telegram surfaces, `URL_AWARE` for the leak-guard markdown-excerpt scan). Migrated five surfaces onto the chokepoint: `__main__._redact_diagnostic_text`, `models.coverage.sanitize_source_error_message`, `visuals.provenance.sanitize_provenance_text`, `briefing.leak_guard.scan`, and (via M1 fix) `notifier/_telegram._redact_bot_token`. Wired the OpenAI cost guard as a triple fail-safe: GHA workflow forces `INVESTO_OPENAI_VISUALS=0` on both daily-briefing entry points, `scripts/check_daily_briefing_env.py` branches on the opt-in flag, and `__main__._validate_env` rejects any runtime opt-in lacking `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Added `pip` ecosystem to `.github/dependabot.yml`. Documented the OpenAI default-off + 3중 fail-safe contract in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` runbook section. Applied M1 (telegram chokepoint shim with marker `[REDACTED_BOT_TOKEN]`) and M2 (5-surface parametrize anti-regression test) pre-merge.
**Status**: Code Generation complete; quality gate passed (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check` 172 files, `mypy --strict src/` 66 source files, `pytest -q` 1147 passed). `mkdocs build --strict` to be re-verified at the u25-u33 wave close.

**Context**: Wave 1 P0 follow-up from the 2026-05-07 persona evaluation (persona #5). u27 consolidates the four divergent sanitize policies into one chokepoint (resolves DEBT-035 / DEBT-036 / DEBT-042) and adds a code-level OpenAI cost guard so the "0원 운영비" KPI is enforced at runtime rather than by convention. QA verdict APPROVE_AFTER_FIXES; M1 (`_telegram._redact_bot_token` chokepoint shim) and M2 (5-surface parametrize anti-regression test) applied pre-merge; M3 (URL_AWARE `_QUERY_REDACT_RE` over-redaction) deferred to DEBT-044; M4 (URL-safe base64 gap in `_LONG_BASE64_RE`) deferred to DEBT-045.

## Construction — u25-u33 Plans REGISTERED (2026-05-08)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-08T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Five-persona user evaluation (2026-05-07) identified P0 / P1 / wish-list follow-up items spanning summary fidelity, visual delivery, secret hygiene, watchlist usability, site discovery, Telegram first-impression, operations resilience, traceability, and watchlist depth. Items decomposed into nine units to keep each plan tightly scoped and reviewable.
**Decision**: Register nine ⏳ Planned units (u25-u33) under three waves: Wave 1 P0 (u25 summary-fidelity-and-content-trust, u26 visual-delivery-integrity, u27 secret-hygiene-unification-and-cost-guard, u28 watchlist-usability-foundation, u29 site-discovery-v2), Wave 2 P1 (u30 telegram-first-impression, u31 operations-resilience), Wave 3 wish-list (u32 trust-traceability-deep-dive, u33 watchlist-depth). All units start with FD ⏭️ SKIP and NFR ⏭️ SKIP; FD/NFR will be promoted only if a step uncovers a new external dependency or NFR-surface change.
**Affected docs**:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u25-summary-fidelity-and-content-trust-code-generation-plan.md`
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u26-visual-delivery-integrity-code-generation-plan.md`

- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (Per-Unit Construction Progress: u25-u33 rows added; Code Generation row Notes appended)
- `aidlc-docs/audit.md` (this entry)
**Status**: Nine plans REGISTERED, awaiting developer dispatch. Suggested execution order matches priority (Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Wave 3); within Wave 1 u27 (DEBT-035/036/042 recovery) is the highest-leverage starting point because it consolidates redaction surfaces other waves rely on.
**Context**: Persona sourcing — u25 (#1, #2, #3 P0); u26 (#2 P0+P1); u27 (#5 P0, recovers DEBT-035 / DEBT-036 / DEBT-042); u28 (#4 P0+P1); u29 (#2 P0+P1+wish-list); u30 (#1 P1); u31 (#5 P1+wish-list); u32 (#3 wish-list); u33 (#4 wish-list). Each plan keeps Steps to 3-5 sub-items so developer can scope per-step PRs cleanly.

## Construction — u7 segmented briefing — Code Generation CLOSED
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-07T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: Completion of the FR-008 segmented briefing implementation loop.
**Decision**: Close `u7 segmented briefing` Code Generation after implementing the full domestic-equity / us-equity / crypto split from routing through Telegram notification.
**Deliverables**:
- Deterministic segment routing helper and tests.
- Segment-aware u2 prompt context with data-limited instructions.
- Segmented archive path and GitHub Pages URL helpers.
- Production orchestrator flow that generates all three segments, writes all three archive files, and commits/pushes them together.
- One Telegram channel message with all three segment summaries and links.
- Documentation/state closeout and code summary.
**Quality gate**:
- `ruff check .` ✅
- `ruff format --check .` ✅
- `mypy --strict src/` ✅
- `pytest -q` ✅ 954/954
- `mkdocs build --strict` ✅
**Status**: CLOSED. Historical unsegmented archive pages remain readable; new production runs publish `archive/{segment}/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Construction — u7 segmented briefing — Unit Created and Planned
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-07T00:00:00+09:00
**Trigger**: User observed that a successful daily briefing over-focused on domestic equity coverage and requested separate briefings for domestic equities, US equities, and crypto.
**Decision**: Add post-MVP unit `u7 segmented briefing` implementing FR-008. The unit splits one daily run into three independent market segments: `domestic-equity`, `us-equity`, and `crypto`. Segmentation happens before LLM generation using deterministic source/category/title/ticker provenance so a strong or high-volume source group cannot dominate unrelated markets.
**Deliverables**:
- Requirements updated with FR-008.
- Unit registry/state updated with `u7 segmented briefing`.
- Functional Design artifacts created under `aidlc-docs/construction/u7-segmented-briefing/functional-design/`.
- Code Generation plan created at `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u7-segmented-briefing-code-generation-plan.md`.
**Key design decisions**:
- New runs will publish `archive/{segment}/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Public URLs will be `{SITE_URL_BASE}/archive/{segment}/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
- One Telegram channel message will contain three summaries and three links.
- If a segment lacks direct source coverage, it must say "데이터 부족" rather than filling with another market's news.
- Existing u2 safety contracts remain mandatory: Claude Code CLI only, retry/budget, disclaimer, leak guard, no Anthropic SDK.
**Status**: Functional Design complete; Code Generation planned and ready to execute.

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension #5 CLOSED (Nasdaq Earnings Calendar)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-03T00:30:00Z
**Trigger**: User requested "earnings 카테고리를 처리하게 team lead에 전달해줘".
**Decision**: Add one `earnings` category adapter, `nasdaq-earnings-calendar`, consuming Nasdaq's public date-scoped earnings calendar JSON endpoint (`https://api.nasdaq.com/api/calendar/earnings?date=YYYY-MM-DD`). This closes the final `Category` gap without a new secret or paid API.
**Deliverables**:
- New source adapter: `src/investo/sources/nasdaq_earnings_calendar.py`
- New tests: `tests/unit/sources/test_nasdaq_earnings_calendar.py` (+18 tests)
- New fixture: `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/nasdaq-earnings-calendar/{calendar.json,meta.json}`
- Plugin discovery and contract updated from 10 to 11 adapters
- FD / application-design / u1 code summary / state tracker updated for Extension #5
**Design notes**:
- Endpoint is date-scoped by `window.target_date.isoformat()`.
- Nasdaq supplies report buckets, not exact timestamps; `published_at` is anchored to UTC midnight on the event date and `raw_metadata["report_time"]` stores `pre-market`, `after-hours`, or `not-supplied`.
- No secret, no paid API, no GitHub Actions change.
- Browser-compatible User-Agent / Origin / Referer headers are adapter-local public access headers, following the Nasdaq Stocks RSS precedent.
**Quality gate**:
- `ruff check src/investo/sources tests/unit/sources` ✅
- `ruff format <changed source/test files>` ✅
- `mypy --strict src/investo/sources` ✅ (20 source files)
- `pytest tests/unit/sources` ✅ 324/324
**QA verdict**: PASS — no Critical/High/Medium findings and no TECH-DEBT. One Low test-helper coverage warning was addressed by adding a terminal HTTP 404 status test.
**Status**: Extension #5 closed. Adapter count 10→11; category coverage 4/5→5/5.
**Context**: Uses the Codex `investo-team` skill. Lead selected the no-secret Nasdaq endpoint, developer implemented, and QA sub-agent review was requested for independent verification.

---

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension #4 CLOSED (Nasdaq Stocks RSS)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-03T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: User requested additional news sources useful for the daily market briefing via `$investo-team`.
**Decision**: Add one official exchange-side news adapter, `nasdaq-stocks-news`, consuming Nasdaq's official `Stocks` category RSS feed (`https://www.nasdaq.com/feed/rssoutbound?category=Stocks`). Candidate review considered Nasdaq and Investing.com RSS. Nasdaq was selected because Nasdaq documents category RSS feeds directly, requires no API key or paid account, and provides US market commentary complementary to Yahoo/CNBC/Yonhap/TheBlock/SEC. Investing.com was deferred because its site terms include broader data redistribution restrictions.
**Deliverables**:
- New source adapter: `src/investo/sources/nasdaq_stocks_news.py`
- New tests: `tests/unit/sources/test_nasdaq_stocks_news.py` (+15 tests)
- New fixture: `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/nasdaq-stocks-news/{feed.xml,meta.json}`
- Plugin discovery and contract updated from 9 to 10 adapters
- FD / application-design / u1 code summary / state tracker updated for Extension #4
**Design notes**:
- Strict R7 applies; no cadence relaxation.
- No secret, no paid API, no GitHub Actions change.
- Adapter sends a fixed non-secret browser-compatible User-Agent because fixture recording showed the Nasdaq RSS endpoint can hang/fail without a UA. Production uses the same UA shape used for fixture recording. This is adapter-local access hygiene, not R14 SEC fair-access compliance.
- `raw_metadata` stays flat `dict[str, str]`: optional `guid`, `creator`, `category`, and comma-normalized `tickers`; empty optional keys are omitted.
**Quality gate**:
- `ruff check src/investo/sources tests/unit/sources` ✅
- `ruff format <changed source/test files>` ✅
- `mypy --strict src/investo/sources` ✅ (19 source files)
- `pytest tests/unit/sources` ✅ 309/309
**QA verdict**: APPROVE_AFTER_FIXES — initial High finding (production UA differed from fixture-recording UA) fixed by aligning production/test/docs to the browser-compatible fixture UA; initial Medium finding (fixture metadata missing status/headers) fixed in `meta.json`. No TECH-DEBT added.
**Status**: Extension #4 closed. Adapter count 9→10; news adapter count 5→6; category coverage unchanged at 4/5 (earnings still TBD).
**Context**: Uses the new Codex `investo-team` skill. Lead selected scope, explorer summarized existing adapter/test patterns, developer implemented, and QA sub-agent review was requested for independent verification.

**Resolution**:
- DEBT-031: `_NS_DC_CREATOR = "{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/}creator"` extracted from `yonhap_market.py` + `theblock_crypto.py` to new `src/investo/sources/_xml_namespaces.py` module exporting `DC_CREATOR: Final[str]`. Both adapters now import it. New module documented as canonical home for any future RSS/Atom/Dublin-Core namespace constants (don't pre-add unused ones).
- DEBT-032: `_SUMMARY_MAX_LEN = 280` (was duplicated in 8 adapter files: cnbc_top_news, coingecko, fomc_rss, fred, sec_edgar_8k, theblock_crypto, yfinance, yonhap_market) lifted to `src/investo/sources/_config.py` as `SUMMARY_MAX_LEN: Final[int] = 280`. All 8 adapters now import the constant. Reused the existing `_config.py` instead of creating a new `_limits.py` per the user's "minimal scope" guidance. `yahoo_finance_news.py` correctly excluded (predates the truncation pattern; no use-site).
**Files**:
- New: `src/investo/sources/_xml_namespaces.py` (10 LOC)
- Modified: `_config.py` + 9 adapter files = 10 src files; net `-7 LOC` in `src/investo/sources/`
- DEBTs marked Resolved in `docs/TECH-DEBT.md`; summary table Medium 7→5
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ / ruff format ✅ / mypy --strict ✅ (47 src files; was 46) / pytest 864/864 (no test changes — pure refactor)
**QA verdict (Phase 2)**: PASS (one-paragraph verification; zero leftover references; imports alpha-sorted; new module conforms to spec).
**DEBT-033 + DEBT-034 status**: deferred per user's "stay tight on these two" constraint. Remain Low priority in the registry.
**Status**: DEBT-031 + DEBT-032 closed. Single source of truth for both `DC_CREATOR` and `SUMMARY_MAX_LEN`. Future news adapter authors automatically inherit the canonical constants.
**Context**: Cleanup pass between extensions; not a new AIDLC stage. Demonstrates the team pattern's value for pure refactor — small change, single dispatch chain, audited and closed in one cycle.

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension #3 CLOSED (3 general news adapters)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T07:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Phase 1-4 of u1-sources-extension-2026-05-news-2 plan completed.
**Deliverables**:
- 3 new source files: src/investo/sources/{yonhap_market,theblock_crypto,cnbc_top_news}.py
- 3 new test files: tests/unit/sources/test_{yonhap_market,theblock_crypto,cnbc_top_news}.py
- 3 new fixtures: tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/{yonhap-market,theblock-crypto,cnbc-top-news}/{feed.xml,meta.json}
- src/investo/sources/__init__.py updated to 9-adapter alpha-sorted import block
- tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py: EXPECTED_ADAPTER_COUNT 6 → 9, names + leaked sets bumped
**Coverage delta**:
- Adapter count: 6 → 9
- News-adapter count specifically: 2 → 5 (Yahoo + SEC + 3 new)
- Category coverage stays 4/5 (news already covered by Ext #2; this is depth not breadth — Korean wire + crypto narrative + macro/policy)
- Total project tests: 810 → 864 (+54 across 3 adapter test files: 16 yonhap + 23 theblock + 15 cnbc)
- Source files in `src/`: 43 → 46
**Cross-cutting QA verdict (Phase 4.4)**: APPROVE_WITH_NOTES — 0 Critical / 0 High / 4 Medium / 4 Low. Findings dispatched as: M1 FD §L6.8 drift fixed in this closeout; M2/M3/M4/L1 → DEBT-031/032/033/034.
**FD divergences ratified**: §L6.8 prose updated to match TheBlock implementation (5-key utm-strip + omit-when-absent + key names `creator`/`categories` per yonhap precedent — superior to the original 2-key+empty-string spec).
**DEBT items added**:
- DEBT-031 (Medium): `_NS_DC_CREATOR` duplicated across 2 adapters → extract to `_xml_namespaces.py`
- DEBT-032 (Medium): `_SUMMARY_MAX_LEN` duplicated across 8 adapters → lift to `_config.py`
- DEBT-033 (Low): `_FEED_URL` placement inconsistency → align sec_edgar_8k to ClassVar
- DEBT-034 (Low): `_mock_client` test helper duplicated 5x → shared `_mock_transport.py`
**DEBT-028 reconfirmation**: news adapters introduce zero numeric `raw_metadata` paths; the precision-drift concern remains scoped to the 3 numeric adapters (yfinance/coingecko/fred). News cohort is clean by construction.
**Final quality gate**: ruff ✅ / ruff format ✅ / mypy --strict ✅ (46 src files) / pytest ✅ 864/864
**Status**: u1 sources Extension #3 CLOSED. The unit becomes eligible for `/cross-check` re-run. News-adapter depth complete: 5 adapters covering English broad (Yahoo) + English official (SEC) + Korean wire (Yonhap) + crypto narrative (TheBlock) + macro/policy (CNBC).
**Context**: Third extension in a row on a unit that AIDLC formally "closed" 3 days ago. Pattern emerging: Construction-closed units may legitimately reopen for product-requirement gaps without that being a process violation, as long as each reopen produces a fresh plan + audit entry + closeout. Worth noting in a future ADR if the pattern continues.

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension #3 Approved (3 general news adapters)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T06:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Extension #2 (yahoo-finance-news + sec-edgar-8k) closed earlier today at 2026-05-01T05:00:00Z and lifted `Category` enum coverage from 3/5 → 4/5 (calendar / price / macro / **news** added). News category is now nominally covered, but the news *stream itself* is thin: only one general-news source (Yahoo Finance) and one corporate-disclosure feed (SEC 8-K). User confirmed the next extension scope: 3 general-news RSS feeds delivered together to diversify language coverage (Korean), narrative angle (crypto), and macro/policy framing (CNBC).
**Decision**: Reopen u1 Code Generation in extension mode for the **third** time today. Add 3 RSS news adapters before re-closing: `yonhap-market` (연합뉴스 마켓+ RSS — first Korean-language news adapter), `theblock-crypto` (The Block RSS — crypto narrative), and `cnbc-top-news` (CNBC US Top News RSS — macro/policy). All three carry `category="news"`. Earnings calendar remains deferred. After Extension #3 closes, `Category` enum coverage is unchanged at 4/5 (still only earnings TBD), but **news depth grows from 2 adapters → 5 adapters**.
**Design Q/A** (resolved with user 2026-05-01 scoping session):
- Q1 Adapter count this extension: **3 adapters bundled in one extension** — same rationale as Extension #2 (one fixture-recording session, one cross-cutting QA pass, one `EXPECTED_ADAPTER_COUNT` bump 6→9).
- Q2 Per-feed item cap: **none — full feed fetched, R7 strict for natural cut** — all three feeds carry per-item RFC 822 `<pubDate>` with explicit timezone offsets (yonhap +0900, theblock -0400, cnbc GMT). R7 strict, no R11 relaxation needed (none of these have a cadence gap — Yonhap publishes throughout the KST business day, The Block publishes intraday US-EDT, CNBC publishes 24/7).
- Q3 Hard item-count cap: **none** — R7 is the only filter.
- Q4 Category for all three: **`category="news"`** — consistent with L6.5 / L6.6.
- Q5 The Block URL canonicalization: **adapter-local utm-strip** — `<link>` items end with `?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss` tracking parameters. The adapter strips these via `urllib.parse` (urlsplit / parse_qsl / urlencode / urlunsplit) before storing so the canonical URL lands in `NormalizedItem.url` and `raw_metadata.guid` (deduplication-friendly downstream). Documented as adapter-local logic in FD §L6.8 — no R-rule needed (no other adapter has this concern; cross-cutting clearance not warranted).
- Q6 CNBC `<metadata:*>` namespace: **ignored entirely** — adapter iterates only the canonical RSS 2.0 `<channel>/<item>` element children (`<title>`, `<link>`, `<pubDate>`, `<description>`, `<guid>`). No registration of the metadata namespace handler. Rationale: the metadata fields (cn:lastPubDate, media:thumbnail, etc.) carry no signal the briefing layer needs and would only enlarge `raw_metadata` for no value. Documented as an explicit adapter-local decision in FD §L6.9.
- Q7 Yonhap CDATA handling: **rely on defusedxml's standard CDATA unwrap + `_sanitize.strip_html`** — Yonhap wraps `<title>` and `<description>` content in `<![CDATA[ ... ]]>`. defusedxml's parser unwraps CDATA transparently (returns the inner text), and `strip_html` then removes any embedded HTML markup. No special-case code needed. Phase 3 qa will confirm the recorded fixture parses cleanly with no encoding garble.
**Lead's pre-decision (no R14-style rule additions) — adopted**:
- All three adapters use UTF-8 encoding (declared in their `<?xml ... encoding="utf-8"?>` header) and RFC 822 `<pubDate>` (which `email.utils.parsedate_to_datetime` handles natively on Python 3.11 — no FD divergence anticipated, unlike L6.5's ISO 8601 `Z`-suffix surprise). No source-mandated compliance headers (none of yonhap.co.kr / theblock.co / cnbc.com require a specific UA per their robots.txt or fair-access policies). httpx's default UA is acceptable for all three.
- The Block utm-strip is **adapter-local logic, not a cross-cutting rule**. Future news adapters that face the same tracking-param issue can adopt the helper pattern by example, but pinning a project-wide R-rule for one adapter's URL canonicalization would over-fit. The planner re-probed business-rules.md and concurs — no rule change.
**DEBT-028 status**: still open as Medium "address before next adapter" carried over from Extension #1 closeout and re-verified clean in Extension #2. Extension #3's adapters carry pure-string `raw_metadata` only:
- yonhap-market: `{"guid": str, "rss_source": str}` (mirror of L6.5)
- theblock-crypto: `{"guid": str, "rss_creator": str, "rss_categories": str}` (`<dc:creator>` + comma-joined `<category>` elements)
- cnbc-top-news: `{"guid": str}` (CNBC has no `<source>` or `<dc:creator>` we surface; metadata namespace ignored per Q6)

No float / int serialization paths in any of the three. **investo-qa will explicitly verify in Phase 3** (cross-cutting review) that the empirical implementation matches this prediction. If verified clean across the now-5 news adapters, DEBT-028 priority logic stays unchanged (still Medium, age clock continues from 2026-05-01).
**Affected docs (this batch — design + planning only; no code yet)**:
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` — u1 row Notes column appended " — Extension #3 in progress (3 general news adapters: yonhap-market + theblock-crypto + cnbc-top-news)"
- `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-dependency.md` — External Dependency Inventory `sources` row extended with the 3 new general-news feeds
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` — L6.7 (yonhap), L6.8 (theblock with utm-strip), L6.9 (cnbc with metadata-ns ignore) added; "Extension #3 note" preface added below the existing extension #2 note
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-rules.md` — **no change** (re-probed; no new cross-cutting concern surfaced)
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u1-sources-extension-2026-05-news-2-code-generation-plan.md` — NEW (4-step plan: yonhap-market → theblock-crypto with utm-strip → cnbc-top-news → registration/contract bump 6→9 + cross-cutting QA + closeout)
**NFR / tech-stack docs**: no AC additions or TS additions in this extension. All three adapters reuse:
- AC-7.6 (defusedxml only) — all three are XML / RSS 2.0
- AC-2.2 (no paid APIs) — all three are free, no auth
- AC-7.3 (http/https URL validation) — all three use `<link>` validated for scheme
- AC-7.2 (HTML stripping on title/summary) — all three use `_sanitize.strip_html`
- AC-7.4 (tz-aware UTC `published_at`) — all three carry tz-aware RFC 822 `<pubDate>` with explicit offsets
- R7 strict — no relaxation, no R11 exception (all three have authoritative per-item pubDate, no cadence gap)
- R8 raw_metadata string-cast — all three carry strings natively
- R10 fixture-recording — all three will record real responses under `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/<slug>/`
- R14 (UA compliance header) — does NOT apply to any of the three (none of yonhap / theblock / cnbc require a fair-access UA)
**Status**: Design + planning docs updated. Code Generation (Extension #3) pending user "approve" on the new plan file.
**Context**: Reopen u1 Code Generation in extension mode for the third time today. Global Build and Test row will re-verify at Extension #3 closeout (Step 4). Plugin contract bump 6→9 lands at Step 4. After this extension closes the same calendar day will have produced three back-to-back planner→developer→qa→closeout cycles for u1 — the cycle has now proven repeatable enough that adapter additions are essentially mechanical.

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension #2 CLOSED (2 news adapters delivered)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T05:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Completion of the 4-step extension #2 plan approved earlier today at 2026-05-01T04:00:00Z (plan file `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u1-sources-extension-2026-05-news-code-generation-plan.md`).
**Deliverables**:
- 2 new source files: `yahoo_finance_news.py` (Yahoo Finance top stories RSS 2.0, `category="news"`) + `sec_edgar_8k.py` (SEC EDGAR 8-K filings Atom 1.0, `category="news"`)
- 2 new test files: `test_yahoo_finance_news.py` (14) + `test_sec_edgar_8k.py` (21) — **+35 tests**
- 2 new fixture directories: `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/yahoo-finance-news/` + `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/sec-edgar-8k/` (real recordings + meta.json)
- `__init__.py` updated; `EXPECTED_ADAPTER_COUNT` 4 → 6; star-import contract re-pinned for the 6-adapter shape
- `_USER_AGENT: Final` lives module-local in `sec_edgar_8k.py` per R14 (SEC fair-access UA is a compliance string, not a secret, not user-overridable)
- Zero new GitHub Secrets required (Yahoo has no auth; SEC's UA is a public identifier) — `daily-briefing.yml` unchanged
**FD divergences ratified (2)**:
1. **L6.5 `<pubDate>` parser** — FD claim "parsed via `email.utils.parsedate_to_datetime`" was empirically wrong: Python 3.11's `parsedate_to_datetime` rejects Yahoo's ISO 8601 `Z`-suffixed form. Implementation uses `datetime.fromisoformat` (after `Z`→`+00:00` substitution where needed). FD L6.5 prose updated in this Phase 4 closeout. The FD bug — if uncorrected — would have invited a future re-reader to "fix" the code back to the broken version.
2. **`SecEdgar8kAdapter` class spelling (lowercase k)** — plan said `SecEdgar8KAdapter`; implementation uses `SecEdgar8kAdapter`. PEP 8 PascalCase digit-letter convention favors lowercase k after a digit (the `k` here is part of the form-name token `8-K`, not a standalone word boundary). qa confirmed defensible; no code change required.
**Cross-cutting code review (Phase 3 qa)**: APPROVE_WITH_NOTES via single sub-agent run covering both adapters together. **0 Critical / 0 High / 2 Medium → both downgraded to Low and registered as DEBT items / 5 Low observations**. All 10 lead-flagged checks (A-J) PASS. Hard-rule audit: Anthropic SDK / module boundary / defusedxml / free tier / R13 secret hygiene / R7 strict — all PASS.
**DEBT-028 status**: STAYS Medium (no escalation). Phase 1's audit prediction held: news adapters carry pure-string `raw_metadata` (`<title>`, `<link>`, `<pubDate>`, `<guid>`, `<source>`, `accession_no`, `filer_cik`, `form_type`, `items`) — zero new numeric serialization paths introduced. Age clock continues from 2026-05-01.
**TECH-DEBT registered (2 new — both Low)**:
- **DEBT-029** (Low): SEC URL-constant placement diverges from sibling adapters (5/6 use class-level `ClassVar[str]`; sec_edgar_8k uses module-level `Final[str]`). Cosmetic; ~5 min fix.
- **DEBT-030** (Low): SEC accession-number extraction uses regex on summary instead of canonical `<id>` element. Works on current fixture; future-fragile if SEC reflows summary HTML. Switch during next re-record pass.
**Coverage delta**:
- Adapter count: 4 → **6**
- `Category` enum coverage: 3/5 → **4/5** (calendar / price / macro / **news** added). Earnings still TBD.
- u1 NFR ACs: 32 → **32** (no new ACs in this extension; AC-7.6 / AC-7.3 / AC-7.2 / AC-7.4 reused)
- Total project tests: 775 → **810** (+35: yahoo +14 / sec +21)
- Source files in `src/`: 41 → **43** (+`yahoo_finance_news.py`, +`sec_edgar_8k.py`)
- u1 tests: 252 base + 55 ext-#1 + 35 ext-#2 = **342**
- Source files in `src/investo/sources/`: 12 → **14**
**Final quality gate** (re-verified at extension #2 closeout):
- `ruff check .` ✅ / `ruff format --check .` ✅
- `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (43 source files: was 41; +`yahoo_finance_news.py`, +`sec_edgar_8k.py`)
- `pytest` ✅ **810/810** passing (was 775; +35 new)
- `mkdocs build --strict` ✅
**Affected docs (this Phase 4 closeout)**:
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` — u1 row updated to "Extension #2 closed" with new test/source counts; global Code Generation + Build and Test rows appended with extension #2 closure note
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/code/summary.md` — Extension #2 closeout section appended
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` — L6.5 `published_at` row corrected to `datetime.fromisoformat` (with rationale + back-pointer to this audit entry)
- `docs/TECH-DEBT.md` — DEBT-029 + DEBT-030 registered (Low); Summary table Low count 12 → 14
**Status**: u1 sources Extension #2 CLOSED. The unit becomes eligible for `/cross-check` re-run. FR-001 news category now covered (4/5 categories; only earnings still TBD).
**Context**: Reopened u1 Code Generation in extension mode for the **second** time today (Extension #1 closed at 2026-05-01T03:00:00Z, Extension #2 approved at 2026-05-01T04:00:00Z, Extension #2 closed at 2026-05-01T05:00:00Z). Re-verified Build and Test stage as part of closeout. Both extensions land in a single calendar day, but each followed the full 4-phase planner→developer→qa→closeout pattern.

---

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension #2 Approved (2 news adapters)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T04:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Extension #1 (yfinance / CoinGecko / FRED) closed earlier today at 2026-05-01T03:00:00Z and lifted `Category` enum coverage from 1/5 → 3/5 (calendar / price / macro). FR-001's news category remains unmet (`Category` still 3/5; earnings deferred). User confirmed the next extension scope: 2 news adapters delivered together.
**Decision**: Reopen u1 Code Generation in extension mode for a second time. Add 2 news adapters before re-closing: `yahoo-finance-news` (Yahoo Finance top stories RSS 2.0) and `sec-edgar-8k` (SEC EDGAR 8-K filings Atom 1.0). Earnings calendar remains deferred. After Extension #2 closes, `Category` enum coverage is 4/5; only earnings still TBD.
**Design Q/A** (resolved with user 2026-05-01):
- Q1 Adapter count this extension: **BOTH adapters in this extension, not one** — bundling reuses one fixture-recording session, one cross-cutting QA pass, one `EXPECTED_ADAPTER_COUNT` bump (4→6).
- Q2 Per-feed item cap: **no per-adapter cap; full feed fetched, R7 strict for natural cut** — both feeds carry per-item `<pubDate>` / `<updated>` so the R7 KST window is the natural bound. Unlike L6.2 (yfinance) or L6.4 (FRED), neither news source has a cadence gap (Yahoo updates continuously; SEC publishes intraday on every weekday). R7 stays strict — no R11-style relaxation.
- Q3 Hard item-count cap: **no per-adapter item cap** — R7 is the only filter. If a feed produces > N items in 24 h that's a downstream u2 budget concern, not a u1 truncation concern.
- Q4 Category for both adapters: **`category="news"`** — even though SEC 8-K is technically corporate disclosure, the briefing-side consumer treats it as news (event-driven content, distinct from price snapshots and macro releases).
**Lead's pre-decision (User-Agent placement) — adopted**:
- `_USER_AGENT: Final = "investo investo@example.com"` lives as a module-level constant in `src/investo/sources/sec_edgar_8k.py` itself, **not** in `sources/_config.py`. Rationale: R12 / `_config.py` covers user-overridable env-var lists (tickers / coins / series). UA is a fixed compliance string per SEC's fair-access policy — different concern, different override semantics (compliance, not user choice). Future news/data adapters that need different UA strings each declare their own constant, keeping per-adapter compliance values local to where they're used. The planner reviewed the lead's judgment and concurs — no override needed.
**R14 decision**: ADD. Source-mandated HTTP request headers are a third axis distinct from R12 (env-var overrides) and R13 (secrets). Pinning the rule now (rather than relying on FD L6.6 prose) makes the next compliance-header source — e.g. a future NewsAPI mandating `X-Api-Key`, or any rate-limit-by-UA endpoint — a 1-line spec lookup instead of a re-derivation. Rule text below the audit entry list.
**DEBT-028 status**: still open as Medium "address before next adapter" after Extension #1 closeout. Extension #2's adapters carry mostly string fields (RSS `<title>` / `<link>` / `<pubDate>` / `<guid>` / `<source>`; Atom `title` / `link` / `summary` / `updated` / accession_no / CIK / Item codes) — no float OHLCV / pct / value fields like the prior batch — so the precision-drift root cause is unlikely to compound here. **investo-qa will explicitly verify in Phase 3** (cross-cutting review Step 4) that neither new adapter introduces fresh raw_metadata numeric serialization paths. If verified clean, DEBT-028 priority logic stays unchanged (still Medium, age clock continues). If new exposure is found, DEBT-028 escalates to High.
**Affected docs (this batch — design + planning only; no code yet)**:
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` — u1 row Notes column appended " — Extension #2 in progress (news adapters: yahoo-finance-news + sec-edgar-8k)"
- `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-dependency.md` — External Dependency Inventory `sources` row narrowed: news committed to in-progress Extension #2 (Yahoo Finance RSS + SEC EDGAR 8-K); only earnings calendar remains TBD
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` — L6.5 (Yahoo Finance news RSS) + L6.6 (SEC EDGAR 8-K) added
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-rules.md` — R14 (source-required HTTP request headers, extension 2026-05-Q2) added
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u1-sources-extension-2026-05-news-code-generation-plan.md` — NEW (4-step plan: yahoo-finance-news → sec-edgar-8k → registration/contract bump → cross-cutting QA + closeout)
**NFR / tech-stack docs**: no AC additions or TS additions in this extension. Both adapters reuse:
- AC-7.6 (defusedxml only) — both are XML
- AC-2.2 (no paid APIs) — both are free, no auth (SEC's UA is a compliance string, not a key)
- AC-7.3 (http/https URL validation) — both use `<link>` / `<link href>` validated for scheme
- R7 strict (no relaxation, no R11 exception) — both have per-item pubDate / updated
- R8 raw_metadata string-cast — both carry strings natively
- R10 fixture-recording — both will record real responses under `tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/<slug>/`
- R14 (NEW) — applies only to `sec-edgar-8k` (Yahoo Finance RSS has no UA requirement; we still send a benign default UA but no compliance string is mandated)
**Status**: Design + planning docs updated. Code Generation (Extension #2) pending user "approve" on the new plan file.
**Context**: Reopen u1 Code Generation in extension mode for the second time. Global Build and Test row will re-verify at Extension #2 closeout (Step 4). Plugin contract bump 4→6 lands at Step 3.

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension CLOSED (3 new adapters delivered)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T03:00:00Z
**Trigger**: Completion of the 5-step extension plan approved earlier today (see entry below).
**Deliverables**:
- 4 new source files: `_config.py` (R12 helper), `yfinance.py`, `coingecko.py`, `fred.py` — total ~720 LOC
- 4 new test files: `test_config.py` (10), `test_yfinance.py` (13), `test_coingecko.py` (15), `test_fred.py` (17) — **+55 tests**
- 6 new fixture files (real recordings: GSPC.json/AAPL.json/markets.json; synthetic: INVALID.json/CPIAUCSL.json/UNRATE.json/DFF.json + meta.json)
- `__init__.py` updated; `EXPECTED_ADAPTER_COUNT` 1 → 4; star-import contract re-pinned
- `daily-briefing.yml` injects `FRED_API_KEY` (optional secret; R13 graceful degradation)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents R12 (env-var override) + R13 (secret handling) patterns; operator runbook lists `FRED_API_KEY` under "optional secrets"
**FD divergences ratified (3)**:
1. L6.2 yfinance R7 relaxation — strict R7 would have produced empty yfinance output on KST Mon/Sat cron fires (US weekend gap). FD updated to "consulted but not enforced"; R11 `Window relaxation for cadence-gapped sources` clause added.
2. L6.4 FRED widened-window 35d → 65d — the 35d bound dropped monthly-indicator prior releases (~60d back) when the latest observation is `"."`. FD narrative + code constant + 3 stale comments aligned.
3. L6.4 FRED title delta precision 2dp → 4dp — code/tests pin 4dp so basis-point-scale changes in DGS10/DFF are visible; spec example updated to match implementation.
**Cross-cutting code review (Step 5.7)**: APPROVE_WITH_NOTES via single sub-agent run covering all 3 new adapters together (per user direction). 0 Critical / 0 High requiring code change / 2 Medium (M1 raw_metadata precision drift, M2 spec drift) / 3 Low cosmetic. H1/L3/M2 fixed in-place; M1 → **DEBT-028** (Medium, pre-next-adapter).
**Coverage delta**:
- Adapter count: 1 → **4**
- `Category` enum coverage: 1/5 (calendar) → **3/5** (calendar / price / macro). News + earnings deferred.
- u1 NFR ACs: 30 → **32** (+AC-3.6 missing-secret graceful degradation, +AC-5.5 env-var override convention)
- Total project tests: 720 → **775** (+55)
- Source files in `src/`: 37 → **41** (+`_config.py`, `yfinance.py`, `coingecko.py`, `fred.py`)
**Final quality gate**: ruff ✅ / ruff format ✅ (114 files) / mypy --strict ✅ (41 src files) / pytest ✅ 775/775 / mkdocs --strict ✅
**Status**: u1 sources Extension CLOSED. The unit becomes eligible for `/cross-check` re-run.
**Context**: Reopened u1 Code Generation in extension mode after Construction phase Build and Test had closed. Re-verified Build and Test stage as part of closeout.

## Construction — u1 sources — Extension Approved (3 new adapters)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z
**Trigger**: User observation that FR-001 AC ("소스 카테고리: 주가/지수, 크립토 시세, 거시 지표, 연준 캘린더, 주요 기업 뉴스, 실적 캘린더") was unmet despite u1's DoD ("1개 이상의 reference 어댑터") being closed at 2026-04-29. FOMC RSS was the only registered adapter, covering only 1 of 5 `Category` enum values (calendar). Application Design's TBD list (component-dependency.md:130) was never narrowed.
**Decision**: Reopen u1 Code Generation in extension mode. Add 3 adapters before Operations: yfinance (price/US 인덱스+메가캡), coingecko (price/crypto), fred (macro). News + earnings categories explicitly deferred to a later extension.
**Design Q/A** (resolved with user 2026-05-01):
- Q1 yfinance call style: **B (direct httpx GET to query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/{ticker})** — matches FD R3 native async + reuses existing `retry_get`; rejects the python `yfinance` library (sync-only, would force `asyncio.to_thread` workaround).
- Q2 NormalizedItem shape for price: **A (one item per ticker, prior-day close snapshot)** — title=`"{ticker} {close} ({pct:+}%)"`; summary carries OHLCV; raw_metadata holds raw numerics.
- Q3 published_at for price items: **A (market close timestamp, UTC tz-aware)** — DST-aware via `zoneinfo("America/New_York")` (NY 16:00 EDT → UTC 20:00; EST → UTC 21:00). Falls naturally inside FD R7 KST window when target_date is the next-day KST trading date.
- Q4 symbols/series: **env-var override** — defaults in code; `INVESTO_YFINANCE_TICKERS`, `INVESTO_COINGECKO_COINS`, `INVESTO_FRED_SERIES` (comma-separated) override at runtime.
- Q5 FRED API key: **GitHub Secrets `FRED_API_KEY`** — injected via env in `daily-briefing.yml`; absent key → that adapter raises `SourceFetchError(transient=False)` once, other adapters unaffected (FD R6 graceful degradation).
**Affected docs (this batch — design + planning only; no code yet)**:
- `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` — u1 row marked extension-in-progress
- `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-dependency.md` — TBD list narrowed (yfinance/CoinGecko/FRED committed; news + earnings still TBD)
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-logic-model.md` — L6.2 (yfinance) / L6.3 (CoinGecko) / L6.4 (FRED) added
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/functional-design/business-rules.md` — R11 (price published_at semantics) / R12 (env-var override convention) / R13 (source-specific secret handling) added
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/nfr-requirements/nfr-requirements.md` — AC-3.6 (missing secret → graceful degradation), AC-5.5 (env-var override pinned), AC-7.6 scope clarified (XML adapters only)
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u1-sources/nfr-requirements/tech-stack-decisions.md` — TS-8 (env-var config helper, no new dep) / TS-9 (FRED key handling, no new dep) added; explicit reject of python `yfinance` library
- `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u1-sources-extension-2026-05-code-generation-plan.md` — NEW (5-step plan: _config helper → yfinance → coingecko → fred → __init__/contract/CONTRIBUTING/closeout)
**Status**: Design + planning docs updated. Code Generation (extension) pending user "approve" on the new plan file.
**Context**: Reopen u1 Code Generation in extension mode after Construction phase Build and Test had closed (the global Build and Test stage will re-run as part of this extension's closeout).

## Construction — Build and Test Stage COMPLETE ✅ (PROJECT CONSTRUCTION CLOSED)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z
**Build status**: ✅ Success (uv lockfile resolved; 37 source files; mkdocs site builds in 0.27s)
**Test status**: ✅ Pass (720 unit + 15 integration; zero failures; zero regressions across all 6 units)
**Files generated** in `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/`:
- `build-instructions.md` (~120 lines): prerequisites (Linux/macOS, Python 3.11, uv ≥0.4, claude CLI for live runs only); 5 production env vars; build steps (uv sync variants); build artifacts (.venv / archive/ / site/ / dist/); troubleshooting (uv lockfile / ConfigError / mkdocs symlink / pytest cache); quality gate.
- `unit-test-instructions.md` (~140 lines): pytest invocation patterns; per-unit test inventory (101 + 252 + 178 + 70 + 56 + 149 + 15 = 720); test categories (PBT / AST-grep deny / record-replay LLM / mocked HTTP); fix-failing-test workflow; what's NOT in automated suite.
- `integration-test-instructions.md` (~120 lines): 15 cross-unit scenarios across 4 files; flagship `test_pipeline.py` wires all 4 mock patterns simultaneously; Q9=B Error Policy coverage table; what integration tests don't cover (operational only).
- `build-and-test-summary.md` (~190 lines): final integrated quality gate; FR/NFR/US coverage tables (8 FR + 7 NFR + 9 US all ✅); 27 open TECH-DEBT items (4 Medium + 23 Low; none blocking); operations next-steps (5 GHA Secrets + Pages enable + manual trigger + verify + wait for cron + monitor first week).
**Performance / Contract / Security / E2E test instructions: NOT generated** — N/A or covered at unit/integration level (single deployable; no microservice contracts; NFR-007 baseline only; integration suite already exercises end-to-end with mocked external services).
**Final integrated quality gate** (all green):
- `ruff check .` ✅
- `ruff format --check .` ✅ (106 files)
- `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (37 source files: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing + 6 publisher + 5 notifier + 4 orchestrator + `__main__`)
- `pytest` ✅ **720 passed in 5.61s**

**Coverage roll-up**:
- 8 FR + 7 NFR + 9 user stories all ✅ closed
- 27 TECH-DEBT items registered (DEBT-001 ~ DEBT-027); 4 Medium / 23 Low; none block the project's first production cron fire
- 6 ratified FD-vs-implementation divergences across u2-u6 (all in audit log)
**Project status**: **CONSTRUCTION PHASE FULLY CLOSED.** All AIDLC stages complete:
- Inception: Workspace Detection ✅ / Reverse Engineering ⏭️ SKIP / Requirements ✅ / User Stories ✅ / Workflow Planning ✅ / Application Design ✅ / Units Generation ✅ (closed 2026-04-26 ~ 2026-04-27)
- Construction: Functional Design ✅ (selective) / NFR Requirements ✅ / NFR Design ⏭️ SKIP / Infrastructure Design ⏭️ SKIP / Code Generation ✅ (all 6 units) / Build and Test ✅ (closed 2026-05-01)
**Next phase**: **Operations** — operator wires the 5 GitHub Secrets, enables Pages, triggers the first manual run, verifies Telegram delivery + Pages render, monitors first week's cron fires.

**Context**: Construction phase Build and Test — final stage CLOSED. All 9 user stories closed; 720/720 tests green; mkdocs build clean; ready for Operations.

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 7 COMPLETE ✅ (UNIT CG CLOSED + ALL 6 UNITS COMPLETE)
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 7 (closeout `summary.md` + final quality gate). Created:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u6-infra-ci/code/summary.md` (~280 lines): comprehensive closeout document. Sections:
  - **Files-created tables**: 348 LOC YAML/config (3 files: daily-briefing.yml / pages.yml / mkdocs.yml) + 94 LOC markdown (3 files: index.md / about.md / archive/index.md) + 1 tracked symlink + 1 .gitkeep + 208 LOC Python side-quest (`__main__.py` extension + 15 new override tests in `test_main.py`) + 122 LOC project metadata (pyproject docs extra + CONTRIBUTING runbook + .gitignore /site/). Total ~770 LOC across 11 modified/created files; 0 new src/test files in `src/investo/` or `tests/unit/orchestrator/`.
  - **DoD verification**: all 4 DoD items from `unit-of-work.md` pass with file:line evidence (cron schedule fires at right times; 5 Secrets injected via env; pages.yml triggers on push; atomic deploy preserves prior site).
  - **Module-boundary verification**: u6 is YAML/config only; the side-quest extension uses stdlib only (no new cross-unit Python import).
  - **NFR / project-rule traceability**: NFR-001 / NFR-002 / NFR-003 (cross-unit) / NFR-004 (cross-unit) / NFR-007 / CLAUDE.md #3 / #5 / FR-006 — all pass with evidence.
  - **Open TECH-DEBT**: 6 new from u6 (DEBT-022 ~ 027, all Low) + 21 cross-unit / pre-existing = 27 total open.
  - **3 ratified FD-vs-implementation divergences**: Step 1.4 `--extra docs` vs `--extra dev` interaction (CI gotcha documented in CONTRIBUTING); Step 2 INVESTO_TARGET_DATE side-quest (small u5 extension surfaced by u6 needs); Step 6 C1 symlink-tracking fix (real correctness bug caught before merge).
  - **Story status**: ✅ US-005 (cron half) closed, ✅ US-003 (Pages half) closed.
  - **All 6 units now closed table**: models (101 tests) + u1 (252) + u2 (178) + u3 (70) + u4 (56) + u5 (149) + u6 (+15 override tests = side-quest); current suite 720/720.
  - **Pre-flight notes for global Build & Test**: build / unit-test / integration-test / site-build instructions; failure-path operator-visibility table.
**Final quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing + 6 publisher + 5 notifier + 4 orchestrator + `__main__`), pytest ✅ **720/720 passed in 5.29s**, `uv run mkdocs build --strict` ✅ ("Documentation built in 0.27 seconds", zero warnings).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved (Step 6's DEBT-022 ~ 027 already registered).
**Status**: ✅ Step 7 complete. Plan checkboxes 7.1 + 7.2 both `[x]`. **u6 infra/CI CG fully CLOSED.** aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "✅ Complete (7/7 — CG fully closed 2026-05-01)". The unit is eligible for `/cross-check`. Stories US-005 (cron half) + US-003 (Pages half) closed.

**🎉 ALL 6 UNITS NOW COMPLETE.** Updated aidlc-state.md Construction Phase section: Functional Design ✅ (selective per-unit, closed 2026-04-30), NFR Requirements ✅ (closed 2026-04-30), NFR Design ⏭️ SKIP, Infrastructure Design ⏭️ SKIP, Code Generation ✅ (all 6 units complete, 2026-05-01), Build and Test ⏳ EXECUTE (next + final stage). All 9 user stories closed. The only remaining stage is **global Build and Test**, which produces the 4 build-and-test instruction artifacts and runs the integrated quality gate one final time.

**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 7 of 7 — UNIT CLOSED — all 6 units complete; Build & Test is the final remaining stage.

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 6 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 6 (sub-agent code review of all u6) of u6 infra/CI Code Generation. Sub-agent verdict: **REQUEST_CHANGES** with single blocker (C1), upgraded to **APPROVE_WITH_FIXES** after the blocker was applied. 1 Critical / 0 High / 5 Medium / 7 Low / 6 TECH-DEBT candidates.

**C1 fix — `site_docs/archive` symlink not tracked in git** (real correctness bug caught before merge):
- The symlink existed in the working copy (created during Step 4 via `ln -s ../archive archive`) but `git add site_docs/archive` had never been run. `git status` showed `?? site_docs/archive` (untracked).
- Impact: on a fresh GHA `actions/checkout@v4`, the symlink would NOT be reconstructed → mkdocs build sees `archive/index.md` referenced in `nav` but NOT present in `docs_dir` → `--strict` fails → **the very first push to `main` would break the Pages workflow before any briefing has shipped**, leaving the public site empty.
- Fix: `git add site_docs/archive`. `git ls-files --stage site_docs/` confirms the file is now staged with mode `120000` (symlink). Re-ran `uv run mkdocs build --strict` → "Documentation built in 0.30 seconds" with zero warnings.

**TECH-DEBT registered (6 new — all Low priority)**:
- **DEBT-022**: `pages.yml` permissions at workflow level instead of job level (M2 — `build` job doesn't need `pages: write` / `id-token: write`; only `deploy` does). Cosmetic least-privilege.
- **DEBT-023**: `daily-briefing.yml` installs `--extra dev` (pytest / hypothesis / ruff / mypy) but never runs them — the job only invokes `python -m investo`. ~10-15s cold-start savings × 6 fires/week with `uv sync --no-dev` (L7).
- **DEBT-024**: `astral-sh/setup-uv@v3` not pinned to SHA in either workflow (L4). Supply-chain hygiene; minimal risk on a 1-person repo.
- **DEBT-025**: `ConfigError.missing_vars` field overloaded for "malformed value" case from the INVESTO_TARGET_DATE side-quest (L6). The 2-mode discriminator (empty tuple = chat-ID-equality; non-empty = missing-var) now has an implicit 3rd mode (non-empty AND var IS present-but-malformed). Suggested: add `bad_value_var` field or a 3rd factory.
- **DEBT-026**: `archive/.gitkeep` redundant alongside `archive/index.md` (L3). Harmless artifact.
- **DEBT-027**: Windows checkout symlink limitation undocumented (Q9 follow-up to C1 fix). Investo runs on Linux/macOS only; defer until a Windows contributor surfaces.

**Deferred without TECH-DEBT (judged sufficient or non-issues on review)**:
- H1 — false-positive: `paths: archive/**` does cover all bot-written archive paths.
- H2 — false-positive: `_resolve_target_date_override()` after `_validate_env()` is intentional fail-fast ordering; httpx never constructed on either error path.
- M1, M3, M4, M5 — passed on second look (permissions correct; concurrency `cancel-in-progress: false` correct for cron+manual serialization; `actor_id` is public; `INVESTO_TARGET_DATE` flows via env not shell + defanged by .strip() + fromisoformat()).
- L1, L2, L5 — minor polish only.

**Sub-agent recommendation honored**: REQUEST_CHANGES blocker (C1) applied before merge → final state APPROVE_WITH_FIXES with all M/L items in the TECH-DEBT registry.

**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files), pytest ✅ **720/720**, `uv run mkdocs build --strict` ✅ (0.30 s, zero warnings — C1 fix verified).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: +6 (DEBT-022 through DEBT-027); 0 resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 6 complete. Plan checkbox 6 `[x]` with full triage. aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "Step 6 of 7 — sub-agent review APPROVE_WITH_FIXES (C1 applied)". Next: **Step 7** — closeout `aidlc-docs/construction/u6-infra-ci/code/summary.md` + final QG. After Step 7 completes, u6 infra/CI CG closes and **all 6 units close**. Stories US-005 (cron half) + US-003 (Pages half) close. Only global Build & Test stage remains.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 6 of 7.

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 5 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 5 (`CONTRIBUTING.md` operator runbook) of u6 infra/CI Code Generation. Step 5.1's pyproject.toml extension was already landed in Step 1.2; Step 5 narrowed to the docs/runbook update.
**Modified**:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (~110 new lines added under existing structure):
  - **Quality gate section**: added a sub-block for docs-touching paths (mkdocs.yml / site_docs/ / pyproject docs extra). Documents `uv sync --extra dev --extra docs` + `uv run mkdocs build --strict` (matches the `pages.yml` CI gate). Local preview: `uv run mkdocs serve` (no `--strict`).
  - **New "Operator runbook (u6 infra/CI)" section** with 5 sub-sections:
    - **GitHub Secrets table**: 5-row reference for the 5 required Secrets with source + purpose; documents CLAUDE.md #5 whitespace-tolerant disjointness check + AC-007-3 best-effort alert behavior.
    - **Cron schedule**: 2-row UTC↔KST mapping table (Mon-Fri 07:00 + Sat 09:00) + KST-no-DST since 1988 footnote.
    - **Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)**: documents the `target_date` ISO-8601 input + fail-fast-on-typo behavior (won't silently roll back to cron default).
    - **US public holidays (Q3=A recovery flow)**: 4-step runbook for empty-collect → operator alert → manual re-trigger with `target_date=last-trading-day`. Leverages FR-006 same-day overwrite contract.
    - **Pages deploy**: documents 2-job (build/deploy) split + atomic deploy preserving prior site on failure (DoD: "빌드 실패 시 기존 사이트 유지").
**TS-10 deny-list regression check**: `pyproject.toml` `[project] dependencies` is unchanged from u5 closeout state (pydantic / httpx / defusedxml / bleach only); no anthropic / tenacity / backoff / pandas_market_calendars / pandas / structlog / loguru / pytz / pendulum / pydantic_settings / respx.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 6 (combined u6 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files unchanged — docs-only step), pytest ✅ **720/720** (unchanged), `uv run mkdocs build --strict` ✅ ("Documentation built in 0.28 seconds").
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 5 complete. Plan checkboxes 5.1 + 5.2 + 5.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "Step 5 of 7 — CONTRIBUTING runbook added". Next: **Step 6** — sub-agent code review of all u6 (focus: YAML syntax + secret handling + cron interpretation + KST DST history + timeout-minutes vs AC-001-4 + permissions least-privilege + atomic deploy + module boundary + zero-cost).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 5 of 7.

---

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 4 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 4 (`mkdocs.yml` + landing pages + archive surface + local build verification) of u6 infra/CI Code Generation. Created/modified:
- `mkdocs.yml` (~95 lines): Material theme + Korean tokenization, 3-entry nav (Home / About / Archive), markdown extensions (admonition / attr_list / footnotes / tables / toc / pymdownx.details + superfences). `docs_dir: site_docs/` keeps the build disjoint from AIDLC `docs/`. `site_url` deliberately omitted to prevent fork/staging URL leakage. `--strict` flag enabled at CLI level in `pages.yml` (not in YAML) so local `mkdocs serve` tolerates drafts.
- Replaced `site_docs/index.md` placeholder with real Korean landing content: 7-section structure overview, free-tier data-source policy, archive + Telegram channel pointers, prominent disclaimer block at bottom (NFR-004 cross-unit).
- Replaced `site_docs/about.md` placeholder with real Korean about page: 운영 원칙, 데이터 소스 (현재 FOMC RSS + 추후 추가 예정), 기술 스택, 면책조항 quote, GitHub source link.
- Surfaced `archive/` via **option (a) — tracked symlink** `site_docs/archive` → `../archive`. Pre-created `archive/.gitkeep` + `archive/index.md` (Korean placeholder for the pre-first-cron state).
- Added `/site/` to `.gitignore` (mkdocs build output; published as Pages artifact, never checked in).

**Local verification** (closes deferred Step 3.2): `uv run mkdocs build --strict` → "Documentation built in 0.23 seconds" with zero warnings. Two iterations to fix: initial run had `--strict` violations on `archive/index.md` in docs_dir but not in nav + unresolved `Archive: archive/` directory ref. Fixed by changing nav to `Archive: [archive/index.md]` (explicit list with index.md as the only required entry; mkdocs auto-discovers future YYYY/MM files).

**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 6 (combined u6 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files unchanged — config-only step), pytest ✅ **720/720** (unchanged from Step 3), `uv run mkdocs build --strict` ✅.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 4 complete. Plan checkboxes 4.1 + 4.2 + 4.3 + 4.4 + 4.5 + 4.6 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "Step 4 of 7 — mkdocs.yml + landing + symlink + build verified". Next: **Step 5** — `pyproject.toml` extension already done in Step 1; Step 5 narrows to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` update (cron schedule, 5 secrets, manual-trigger flow w/ `target_date` input, `uv run mkdocs build --strict` for local preview, US-public-holiday recovery flow).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 4 of 7.

---

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 3 (`pages.yml` — mkdocs build + actions/deploy-pages) of u6 infra/CI Code Generation. Created:
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (~110 lines): GHA Pages deploy workflow.
  - **Triggers**: `push` on `main` w/ `paths:` filter (`archive/**`, `site_docs/**`, `mkdocs.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/pages.yml`) — saves GHA minutes by skipping rebuilds for unrelated changes; `workflow_dispatch` for manual rebuild.
  - **Permissions** at workflow level: `pages: write`, `id-token: write` (OIDC), `contents: read`. Workflow-wide because both jobs need the Pages permissions.
  - **Concurrency**: `group: pages, cancel-in-progress: true` — coalesces rapid pushes to the latest commit. Safe for static site.
  - **Two jobs** per GHA Pages convention:
    - `build` (timeout-minutes: 5): checkout → setup-uv → Python 3.11 → `uv sync --extra docs` (replaces dev deps with docs deps; mkdocs build doesn't need pytest/mypy) → `uv run mkdocs build --strict` (FR-006 quality gate; --strict fails on broken links / unrecognized config) → `actions/configure-pages@v5` → `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 with: path: site`.
    - `deploy` (needs: build, timeout-minutes: 5): `actions/deploy-pages@v4` w/ `environment: { name: github-pages, url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} }` so the Pages URL surfaces in the workflow run.
  - **DoD: "빌드 실패 시 기존 사이트 유지"** ✅ — implicit via GHA's deploy-pages atomic swap. If `mkdocs build --strict` fails or upload fails, no artifact is published and the previously-deployed site remains live at `gh-pages`. No manual rollback needed.
  - **Workflow split rationale** documented in YAML comment header: splitting from `daily-briefing.yml` keeps each job's `permissions:` minimal (least privilege — briefing has `contents: write` only; pages has the Pages-specific triple), lets a manual `mkdocs.yml` change trigger only this workflow, and makes failures easier to attribute (briefing red ≠ pages red).
**Local `mkdocs build --strict` verification deferred to Step 4** (which lands `mkdocs.yml` + the real `site_docs/` content). The workflow is a pure data artifact at this step — it can't run successfully until Step 4 completes, but checking it in here keeps the step boundaries clean (each step yields one commit per the plan dependency graph).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 6 (combined u6 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files unchanged — YAML-only step), pytest ✅ **720/720** (unchanged from Step 2; no Python changes).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 3 complete. Plan checkboxes 3.1 + 3.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "Step 3 of 7 — pages.yml". Next: **Step 4** — `mkdocs.yml` + `site_docs/index.md` + `site_docs/about.md` real content + archive symlink + local `uv run mkdocs build --strict` verification (closes the deferred Step 3.2 verification).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 3 of 7.

---

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 2 (`daily-briefing.yml`) of u6 infra/CI Code Generation. Created:
- `.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml` (~85 lines): cron schedule (UTC `0 22 * * 0,1,2,3,4` for KST Mon-Fri 07:00 + UTC `0 0 * * 6` for KST Sat 09:00), `workflow_dispatch` w/ optional `target_date` input, job `briefing` with `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`, `timeout-minutes: 12` (AC-001-4), `permissions: contents: write`, concurrency group serializing manual + cron fires. Steps: `actions/checkout@v4` (fetch-depth=0) → `astral-sh/setup-uv@v3` → `uv python install 3.11` → `uv sync --extra dev` → git config bot author → `uv run python -m investo` with 5 Secrets + `INVESTO_TARGET_DATE` env var. Comprehensive YAML comment header documents schedule (KST↔UTC + KST-no-DST since 1988), permissions, secrets, and exit-code mapping.

**Side-quest closed** — gap surfaced by writing the workflow: `__main__.py` did NOT honor `INVESTO_TARGET_DATE` so the workflow_dispatch input would have been a non-functional UI element. Closed by extending `__main__.py`:
- Added `_TARGET_DATE_OVERRIDE_VAR: Final[str] = "INVESTO_TARGET_DATE"` constant.
- Added `_resolve_target_date_override() -> date | None` helper: empty / whitespace-only / absent → None; non-empty → `date.fromisoformat(raw.strip())`; malformed → `ConfigError("...not a valid ISO-8601 date...", missing_vars=("INVESTO_TARGET_DATE",))` for fail-fast + actionable alert text. **Critical**: malformed override MUST NOT silently roll back to the cron-resolved date — that would publish for the wrong date entirely.
- `_async_main` parses the override inside the same try/except as `_validate_env` (fail-fast before httpx construction), then forwards `target_date_override` positionally to `run_pipeline`.
- 15 new tests in `test_main.py`: absent → None (1), empty string → None (1), whitespace-only → None (1), valid ISO → date (1), whitespace-tolerant strip (1), 6-parametrized malformed cases → exit 1 (wrong separator, MM-DD-YYYY, invalid month, invalid day for April, natural language, missing day), malformed → AC-007-3 boot-alert fires (1), 3 direct unit tests of the helper (`returns_none_when_absent`, `returns_date_when_valid`, `raises_on_malformed`).

**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 6 (combined u6 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (105 files; 1 auto-formatted in `__main__.py`), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files — `__main__.py` extended in place; no new src file), pytest ✅ **720/720 passed in 5.72s** (+15 override tests; zero regressions in the prior 705).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 2 complete. Plan checkboxes 2.1 + 2.2 + 2.3 all `[x]` + side-quest documented in plan. aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "Step 2 of 7 — daily-briefing.yml". Next: **Step 3** — `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (mkdocs build + actions/deploy-pages on push to main + workflow_dispatch).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 2 of 7.

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Step 1 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 1 (bootstrap) of u6 infra/CI Code Generation. Created:
- `.github/workflows/` directory (was absent — first GHA workflow files land in Step 2 / 3).
- `site_docs/` directory (mkdocs source root, kept disjoint from existing `docs/` AIDLC documentation root per the path-collision resolution noted in the plan).
- `site_docs/index.md` and `site_docs/about.md` placeholder pages — Step 4 fills them with real content.
**Modified**:
- `pyproject.toml`: added `[project.optional-dependencies] docs = ["mkdocs-material>=9.5"]`. Inline comment ratifies the dev/docs split (NFR-002 minimal-runtime — runtime install carries only pydantic / httpx / defusedxml / bleach; mkdocs lives in the optional `docs` group). Pin floor 9.5 for Korean-friendly default search tokenization.
**Verification**: `uv sync --extra dev --extra docs` resolves cleanly; `uv run mkdocs --version` returns 1.6.1.
**Important note for CI**: `uv sync --extra docs` ALONE replaces dev deps (uv's default behavior). CI's Pages job MUST use `uv sync --extra dev --extra docs` (or just `--extra docs` if dev deps aren't needed for the build, which is the case for `mkdocs build --strict`). Documented in Step 5's CONTRIBUTING.md update.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files unchanged — no Python source changes in u6), pytest ✅ **705/705 passed in 8.11s** (unchanged from u5 closeout; bootstrap-only).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 1 complete. Plan checkboxes 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3 + 1.4 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u6 row updated to "Step 1 of 7 — bootstrap". Next: **Step 2** — `.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml` (cron + workflow_dispatch + `uv run python -m investo` with 5 GHA Secrets injected per AC-007-1, `timeout-minutes: 12` per AC-001-4).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 2 Step 1 of 7.

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Plan APPROVED ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**User Input**: "approve"
**AI Response**: Approval recorded. Proceeding to Step 1 (bootstrap).
**Status**: Code Generation plan APPROVED (7 steps). Beginning Part 2 execution.
**Context**: u6 infra/CI Code Generation Part 1 (Planning) → Part 2 (Execution) transition. **u6 is the final unit.**

## Construction — u6 infra/CI — Code Generation Plan (Part 1 Planning)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Entered Code Generation stage for u6 infra/CI — the **final** unit. FD + NFR Requirements both N/A per execution-plan (YAML/config only; no new Python source code). Created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u6-infra-ci-code-generation-plan.md` with 7 numbered steps:
- **Step 1** Bootstrap (`.github/workflows/` directory + pyproject `[project.optional-dependencies] docs = ["mkdocs-material>=9.5"]` + placeholder landing pages).
- **Step 2** `.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml`: cron schedule (UTC Sun-Thu 22:00 = KST Mon-Fri 07:00 + UTC Sat 00:00 = KST Sat 09:00) + workflow_dispatch w/ optional target_date input. Job runs `uv run python -m investo` with the 5 GHA Secrets injected via `env:` per AC-007-1. `timeout-minutes: 12` per AC-001-4. `permissions: contents: write` for git push.
- **Step 3** `.github/workflows/pages.yml`: triggered on push to main + workflow_dispatch. `uv sync --extra docs` + `uv run mkdocs build --strict` + `actions/deploy-pages@v4` for atomic deploy (failure preserves prior site per DoD).
- **Step 4** `mkdocs.yml` + landing pages. Reads from `site_docs/` (NOT `docs/` — keeps AIDLC docs untouched per CLAUDE.md project-structure). 3 nav entries (Home / About / Archive). Archive dir surfaced via symlink option for minimum moving parts (decision deferred to impl per Step 4.4).
- **Step 5** `pyproject.toml` + `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Adds `[project.optional-dependencies] docs` (mkdocs-material). CONTRIBUTING documents cron schedule (KST↔UTC + DST note), 5 Secret names, manual-trigger flow for US-holiday recovery (Q3=A backfill).
- **Step 6** Sub-agent code review.
- **Step 7** Closeout `aidlc-docs/construction/u6-infra-ci/code/summary.md` + final QG.
**Approval Prompt**: "Reply 'approve' to begin Step 1, or 'changes [N]' to revise step N."
**Files modified**: created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u6-infra-ci-code-generation-plan.md`; updated `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (u6 row → "CG plan created — awaiting approval"); this audit entry.
**Status**: Plan ready; awaiting user approve/changes response. **u6 is the final unit** — after closure, only global Build & Test remains.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u6 infra/CI, Part 1 (Planning).

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 13 COMPLETE ✅ (UNIT CG CLOSED)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 13 (closeout `summary.md` + final quality gate). Created:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u5-orchestrator/code/summary.md` (~280 lines): comprehensive closeout document. Sections:
  - **Files-created table**: 5 src files + 1 model extension = 1,292 LOC source; 9 unit test files + 1 integration test = 3,518 LOC / 143 tests; +6 from PipelineResult.stage_timings model tests = 149 tests added by u5.
  - **Surface area table**: 4 public re-exports (`run_pipeline`, `resolve_target_date`, `ConfigError`, `EmptyCollectError`); `main` deliberately NOT re-exported per Python convention; 9 internal helpers also not re-exported.
  - **Cross-unit imports verification**: u5 imports from `models / sources / briefing / publisher / notifier` (CLAUDE.md #3 license — u5 is the ONLY unit allowed to do this). Other 4 units verified across u1-u4 reviews to not import each other.
  - **FR / NFR traceability**: 39 AC × test pin: NFR-001 (5 — incl. 2 AST-grep deny tests + 2 stage_timings tests + GHA timeout deferred to u6), NFR-003 (11 — full Q9=B Error Policy table; AC-003-1 ~ AC-003-11), NFR-005 (8 — date resolution + logging + StrEnum + frozen pydantic), NFR-006 (5 — integration mocks + per-failure-row + DI seam + PBT + ≥30 unit tests / ACTUAL 143 u5 tests), NFR-007 (5 — env validation + chat-ID disjointness + best-effort alert + redaction proxy + no-env-values-in-logs).
  - **Open TECH-DEBT**: 5 new from u5 (DEBT-017 through DEBT-021, all Low) + 16 cross-unit / pre-existing = 21 open. None block u5.
  - **6 ratified FD-vs-implementation divergences**: Step 5 callable-injection vs class-injection (u1 aggregator is module-level fetch_all not class), Step 6 direct await vs asyncio.to_thread (u2 already async-native), Step 6 `_default_generate_briefing` adapter (positional vs keyword-only API), Step 9 skipped-stage convention (no key in stage_timings for stages that didn't run), Step 10 FailureStage Literal extension with "orchestrator" 5th value, Step 12 H1+H2 fixes from sub-agent review (`_safe_alert` Exception broadening + chat-ID whitespace-tolerance).
  - **Story status**: ✅ US-005 closed.
  - **Pre-flight for u6 infra/CI**: GHA workflow YAML (cron schedule, timeout-minutes:12, 5 secrets, `python -m investo` entrypoint), Pages YAML, CONTRIBUTING.md update. **No new Python source code.** Failure-path table mapping each Q9=B failure to operator visibility (OperatorAlerter / GHA email / channel manual check) and latency.
**Final quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (**37 source files**: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing + 6 publisher + 5 notifier + 4 orchestrator + `__main__`), pytest ✅ **705/705 passed in 5.32s** (252 u1+models baseline + 178 u2 + 70 u3 + 56 u4 + 149 u5 = 705 total). Zero regressions across the entire test suite.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved (Step 12's DEBT-017/018/019/020/021 already registered).
**Status**: ✅ Step 13 complete. Plan checkboxes 13.1 + 13.2 both `[x]`. **u5 orchestrator CG fully CLOSED.** aidlc-state.md u5 orchestrator row updated to "✅ Complete (13/13 — CG fully closed 2026-04-30)". The unit is eligible for `/cross-check`. Story US-005 is closed. **Next: u6 infra/CI** (the final unit — YAML/config only; FD/NFR both N/A per execution-plan; no new Python source; just GHA workflow YAML + Pages YAML + CONTRIBUTING.md update). After u6: global Build and Test.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u5 orchestrator, Part 2 Step 13 of 13 — UNIT CLOSED.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 12 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 12 (sub-agent code review of all u5) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Sub-agent verdict: **APPROVE_WITH_FIXES** (0 Critical / 2 High / 3 Medium / 7 Low / 5 TECH-DEBT candidates). Applied changes:

**H1 fix — `_safe_alert` exception list misses common transport errors** (`src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py:653`):
- Original: `except (OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError) as alert_exc:` — narrow tuple meant to absorb alerter bugs without masking the underlying stage failure.
- Problem: `httpx.HTTPError` is NOT a subclass of OSError/RuntimeError; `asyncio.TimeoutError` similarly leaks; arbitrary `TypeError`/`AttributeError` from a future u4-contract change would propagate and replace the `FAILED` exit code with an unrelated traceback. Asymmetric with `_attempt_boot_alert` which DOES catch httpx.HTTPError.
- Fix: broaden to `except Exception as alert_exc:` to honor the documented intent ("broken alerter should not mask underlying failure"). KeyboardInterrupt / SystemExit / asyncio.CancelledError (BaseException) still propagate so an operator's Ctrl-C is not swallowed.
- 7 regression tests added: 6-parametrized `test_run_pipeline_safe_alert_swallows_arbitrary_exceptions` covering OSError / RuntimeError / ValueError (already-caught) + TypeError / AttributeError / ZeroDivisionError (newly-caught); 1 `test_run_pipeline_safe_alert_lets_base_exception_propagate` confirming KeyboardInterrupt still propagates.

**H2 fix — chat-ID disjointness not whitespace-tolerant** (`src/investo/__main__.py:112`):
- Original: `if channel_id == operator_id:` raw string comparison.
- Problem: a leading/trailing space in one GitHub Secret silently bypassed CLAUDE.md #5 — Telegram resolves both `"@invest_brief"` and `" @invest_brief"` to the same chat, but `==` says they're different. Result: public channel could receive operator alerts.
- Fix: strip all 5 env vars during `_validate_env`. Stripped values flow forward to dispatcher construction in canonical form so downstream callers see the same canonical strings.
- 5-parametrized regression test added: `test_main_rejects_chat_ids_equal_after_whitespace_strip` covering leading/trailing space, leading/trailing newline, and mixed whitespace combinations.

**TECH-DEBT registered (5 new)**:
- **DEBT-017** (Low): `_TRACEBACK_EXCERPT_MAX_CHARS` duplicated between `pipeline.py` and `models/results.py` — both must agree or FailureContext construction silently breaks.
- **DEBT-018** (Low): AST-grep deny tests use substring matching, brittle to future `_stage_*` rename.
- **DEBT-019** (Low): `resolve_target_date` PBT covers only 2026, missing leap-year edges.
- **DEBT-020** (Low): post-H1 `_safe_alert` (Exception) and `_attempt_boot_alert` (narrow) exception lists not aligned. Sub-issue of L6.
- **DEBT-021** (Low): unused `PublisherError` re-export in `pipeline.__all__` (claimed for `__main__` use but `__main__` doesn't import it).

**Deferred without TECH-DEBT (judged sufficient)**:
- M1: `_attempt_boot_alert` pydantic ValidationError leak — subsumed under DEBT-020 (boot path needs same broadening).
- M2: `_briefing_url_for` URL-encoding — ints + ISO-date have no reserved chars; HttpUrl validation fails closed.
- M3: pipeline_start microsecond timing inconsistency — irrelevant.
- L3: integration test fixture loaded but unused on empty-collect path — harmless.
- L7: pyproject sanity (no anthropic/pandas-market-calendars) — already passes.

**Sub-agent recommendation honored**: APPROVE_WITH_FIXES — H1 + H2 applied before close; 5 TECH-DEBT registered; M/L items deferred per priority reasoning.

**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ (initial RUF100 unused-noqa from H1 inline comment → fixed), ruff format ✅ (106 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files), pytest ✅ **705/705 passed in 5.90s** (+12 regression tests = 7 H1 + 5 H2; zero regressions in the prior 693).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: +5 (DEBT-017 through DEBT-021); 0 resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 12 complete. Plan checkbox 12 `[x]` with full triage details. aidlc-state.md u5 CG column updated to "Step 12 of 13 — sub-agent code review APPROVE_WITH_FIXES applied". Next: **Step 13** — closeout `aidlc-docs/construction/u5-orchestrator/code/summary.md` + final quality gate. After Step 13 completes, u5 orchestrator CG closes and unit becomes eligible for `/cross-check`. **u6 infra/CI** is the only remaining unit (YAML/config only).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u5 orchestrator, Part 2 Step 12 of 13.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 11 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 11 (`__init__.py` public surface + integration test) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation.
**Files modified**:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/__init__.py`: replaced `__all__: list[str] = []` placeholder with the 4-name public surface (`run_pipeline`, `resolve_target_date`, `ConfigError`, `EmptyCollectError`). `main` deliberately NOT re-exported here — it lives in `investo.__main__` per Python convention and `python -m investo` finds it there; re-exporting from `investo.orchestrator` would be redundant and create two import paths for the same symbol. Inline comment documents the decision.
- `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` (~430 lines, **7 tests**): end-to-end tests wiring all 4 mock patterns simultaneously per AC-006-1 + AC-006-3. Test architecture:
  - **u1**: fake `fetch` callable (we don't drive FomcRssAdapter against MockTransport — that's exercised by `test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py`; here we only care that `_stage_collect` plumbing surfaces the items).
  - **u2**: `stub_u2_claude` fixture monkeypatches `investo.briefing.pipeline.call_claude_code` with canned Stage1 + Stage2 stubs (mirrors `test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py` pattern) and disables `_BACKOFF_SCHEDULE` so retries don't add wall-clock delay. **Drives the real `generate_briefing`** so the round-trip exercises u2's prompt-generation + parsing + disclaimer-append + leak-guard layers.
  - **u3**: `isolated_archive` fixture redirects `ARCHIVE_ROOT` to `tmp_path` and disables `time.sleep` in u3's git_ops backoff. Real `write_briefing` writes to disk; fake `_SuccessfulGitRunner` records add/commit/push.
  - **u4**: single shared `httpx.AsyncClient(transport=MockTransport)` handles both `BriefingPublisher.send` (chat_id=public) and any `OperatorAlerter.alert` (chat_id=operator) via per-test handler that routes by `chat_id`.

  Test coverage:
  - AC-006-1 happy path: SUCCESS, all 4 stage_timings, real file on disk with disclaimer ("투자 자문" or "면책"), git add/commit/push sequence, public-channel send with per-day URL footer, NO operator alert.
  - AC-003-2 empty collect: FAILED + 1 operator alert (lands at operator chat ID, NOT public channel) + u2/u3/public never invoked.
  - AC-003-6 / AC-003-8 notify failure: Telegram `{"ok":false}` → PARTIAL + briefing_url set + NO operator alert + file still on disk + git lifecycle ran.
  - CLAUDE.md #5 chat-ID isolation: empty-collect failure path issues exactly 1 Telegram call → asserts `chat_ids_seen == [_OPERATOR_CHAT]`, public channel never received anything.
  - Public-surface importability: 4 names resolve from `investo.orchestrator`; internal `_stage_*` NOT exposed; `main` NOT re-exported per Step 11.1 design; `__all__` exact set check; types verified.
  - `resolve_target_date` round-trip via re-export (catches accidental shadowing in __init__).

**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ (3 F401 unused imports auto-fixed: `ConfigError`, `EmptyCollectError`, `logging` from initial draft), ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files; `__init__.py` extended in place — no new src file), pytest ✅ **693/693 passed in 5.30s** (+7 integration tests; zero regressions in the prior 686).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 11 complete. Plan checkboxes 11.1 + 11.2 + 11.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u5 CG column updated to "Step 11 of 13 — public surface + integration test". **The orchestrator is now functionally complete and pinned by integration tests at the public boundary.** Next: **Step 12** — sub-agent code review of all of u5 (focus areas: Q9=B routing correctness, time accounting on failure paths, env-validation order, best-effort-alert robustness, async-sync interaction at the asyncio.to_thread boundaries, test isolation, logging conventions, CLAUDE.md #5 enforcement).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u5 orchestrator, Part 2 Step 11 of 13.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 10 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 10 (`main()` entrypoint with env validation + best-effort alert + exit codes) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Modified:
- `src/investo/__main__.py`: replaced the NotImplementedError stub with a ~210-line entrypoint covering AC-007-1 ~ AC-007-5 + AC-003-7. Five helpers: `_missing_env_vars` (treats `""` as missing per GHA Secrets behavior), `_validate_env` (5-tuple return, ConfigError on missing/equal-chat-ids/bad-URL), `_attempt_boot_alert` (best-effort, catches construction + dispatch errors), `_async_main` (1st try ConfigError → alert + 1; 2nd try shared httpx.AsyncClient + dispatcher construction + run_pipeline; status → 0/0/1; top-level Exception per AC-003-7 → log.exception + alert + 1, never propagates), `main()` sync wrapper.
- `src/investo/models/results.py`: extended `FailureStage` Literal to include `"orchestrator"` as the 5th value — the explicit stage name for env-validation ConfigError + AC-003-7 unexpected-exception paths. Semantically clearer than reusing one of the four stage names. Inline comment ratifies the addition.
- `tests/unit/models/test_results.py`: extended `_FAILURE_STAGES` tuple to include `"orchestrator"` so the parametrized round-trip test covers all 5 values.
- `tests/unit/models/test_roundtrip.py`: extended `_FAILURE_STAGES` strategy to include `"orchestrator"` so hypothesis PBT covers it.
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_main.py` (~360 lines, **25 tests**): AC-007-1 (3 — 5-parametrized missing-var, empty-string, multi-missing); AC-007-2 (1 — chat-id equality, pipeline never invoked); AC-007-3 (3 — prereqs present → 1 alert with stage="orchestrator"; bot_token missing → no alert; operator_chat_id missing → no alert); site URL parsing (2); exit-code mapping (1 parametrized over SUCCESS|PARTIAL|FAILED); AC-003-7 (2 — KeyError → alert(orchestrator, KeyError); RuntimeError without prereqs → no alert); happy path (2); `_missing_env_vars` helper (2); best-effort robustness (2 — FailureContext construction silenced, alerter OSError silenced); forward-args sanity (1).
**Test architecture**: `_stub_pipeline` + `_capture_alerts` context-manager helpers monkeypatch `run_pipeline` and `OperatorAlerter` symbols inside `__main__`'s import binding. This avoids real u1-u4 wiring + real httpx + real Telegram during unit tests, while exercising the exact `main()` code path (DI by symbol replacement, not signature change).

**FailureStage Literal extension** ratified here (Step 10.3): adding `"orchestrator"` is a backward-compatible addition (old `FailureContext` consumers still accept the 4 original values; new code can construct `FailureContext(stage="orchestrator", ...)`). Models test parametrizations were updated in lockstep.

**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ (3 F401 unused imports auto-fixed: leftover `UTC`/`datetime`/`Iterator` from initial draft + 1 unused fixture import), ruff format ✅ (105 files), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files — `__main__.py` rewritten in place; no new src file), pytest ✅ **686/686 passed in 5.08s** (+25 main tests + 1 from FailureStage extension touching the parametrized models tests; zero regressions in the prior 660).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 10 complete. Plan checkboxes 10.1 + 10.2 + 10.3 + 10.4 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u5 CG column updated to "Step 10 of 13 — main entrypoint". Next: **Step 11** — finalize `src/investo/orchestrator/__init__.py` public surface (re-export `run_pipeline`, `resolve_target_date`, `ConfigError`, `EmptyCollectError`; `main()` lives in `__main__.py` per Python convention so not re-exported). Plus `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` end-to-end with all 4 existing mock patterns (httpx.MockTransport for u1+u4 + FakeClaudeRunner for u2 + fake GitRunner for u3).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u5 orchestrator, Part 2 Step 10 of 13.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 9 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9 (`run_pipeline` composer — Q9=B Error Policy router across 11 ACs). Modified:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`: extended with `run_pipeline` + 3 helpers (`_safe_alert`, `_build_failure_context`, `_briefing_url_for`, `_build_result`).
  - Signature: `async def run_pipeline(target_date=None, *, publisher, alerter, site_url_base, fetch=None, runner=None, git_runner=None, generate=None) -> PipelineResult`. DI seams forward to each stage runner. `target_date=None` resolves via `resolve_target_date(datetime.now(UTC))`.
  - Q9=B routing sequential per Q5: collect → generate → publish → notify_briefing. Each catalogued failure converted into `FailureContext` and routed to `alerter.alert(...)` via `_safe_alert`; status=FAILED + downstream stages marked "skipped". Notify failure alone → PARTIAL with NO alert (per AC-003-6 — PARTIAL is the visibility signal).
  - **No retry** at orchestrator boundary (Q4=A); **no `asyncio.wait_for`** wrap (Q1=A); **no stage-level `asyncio.gather`** (Q5).
  - Stage timings recorded for each executed stage; skipped stages have no timing key (operators see "where time went" without confusing zeros).
  - Briefing URL: `_briefing_url_for(target_date, site_url_base)` builds `{base}/{YYYY}/{MM}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/`, threaded into both `_stage_notify_briefing(site_url=...)` and `PipelineResult.briefing_url`.
  - `_safe_alert` covers AC-003-10: alerter `ok=False` → WARNING + status stays FAILED; alerter raising (programmer error in stub) → catches `OSError | RuntimeError | ValueError`, logs WARNING, status stays FAILED — does NOT mask the underlying stage failure.
  - `_build_failure_context` truncates traceback to ≤2000 chars (matches `FailureContext.traceback_excerpt` validator) and falls back to `type(exc).__name__` if `str(exc)` is empty (so `error_message` min_length=1 invariant holds).
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_run_pipeline.py` (~700 lines, **25 tests** vs plan's 9 target — high effort):
  - Happy path (2): SUCCESS + 4 stage_timings + briefing_url + no alert; target_date=None resolves to a weekday.
  - AC-003-1 + AC-003-9 (2): per-source partial → SUCCESS, NOT PARTIAL.
  - AC-003-2 (1): empty collect → FAILED + alert(collect, EmptyCollectError); downstream skipped; publisher never called.
  - AC-003-3 (1 parametrized over 4 BGE stages): FAILED + alert(generate, BriefingGenerationError).
  - AC-003-4 (1): PublisherDisclaimerError → FAILED + alert(publish, PublisherDisclaimerError); notify skipped.
  - AC-003-5 (1): push exhaustion → FAILED + alert(publish, PublisherGitError) with idempotent-noop retry handled.
  - AC-003-6 + AC-003-8 (1): notify ok=False → PARTIAL with briefing_url + NO alert.
  - AC-003-10 (2): alerter ok=False during FAILED → status stays FAILED + WARNING; alerter raising → status stays FAILED + "alert raised unexpected" WARNING.
  - AC-001-1 (2): stage_timings populated on success (all 4 keys, non-negative); on abort, only ran stages get timings.
  - Programmer error (1): aggregator RuntimeError → propagates (AC-003-7 main()-level catch).
  - URL composition (2): trailing-slash base normalized; month padded.
  - Total duration sanity (1).
  - `_build_failure_context` (2): traceback truncated to ≤2000; empty `str(exc)` falls back to class name.
  - **AST-grep deny tests (3)** — AC-001-3 (no `asyncio.wait_for(_stage_*`), AC-001-5 (no stage-level `asyncio.gather` — walks AST for gather calls and asserts no positional arg contains `_stage_`), AC-003-11 (no retry loops — walks AST for For/While whose body contains `await _stage_*`).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ (F401 unused imports + 2× E501 long-line in fake ctors → fixed via `--fix` + manual line-break), ruff format ✅ (1 auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (initial unused-`type: ignore` on `FailureContext.stage=stage` — narrowing to str accepted; comment removed), pytest ✅ **660/660 passed in 5.03s** (+25 tests; zero regressions in the prior 635).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 9 complete. Plan checkboxes 9.1 + 9.2 + 9.3 + 9.4 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u5 CG column updated to "Step 9 of 13 — run_pipeline composer". **The orchestrator's behavioral surface is now complete**: 4 stage runners + Q9=B router. Next: **Step 10** — `main()` entrypoint (replace `src/investo/__main__.py`'s NotImplementedError stub) with env validation per AC-007-1 (5 vars), CLAUDE.md #5 chat_id disjointness ConfigError per AC-007-2, best-effort alert per AC-007-3, exit-code mapping (SUCCESS|PARTIAL → 0; FAILED → 1), and top-level exception alert per AC-003-7.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 8 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8 (`_stage_notify_briefing` — wraps u4 `BriefingPublisher.send` + `build_summary`) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Modified:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`:
  - Added imports: `pydantic.HttpUrl`, `BriefingNotification`, `SendResult`, `BriefingPublisher`, `build_summary`.
  - Added `async def _stage_notify_briefing(briefing, *, publisher, site_url) -> SendResult`:
    - INFO `[notify_briefing] starting target_date=...` on entry.
    - 3-phase composition: `build_summary(briefing, site_url=str(site_url))` → `BriefingNotification(...)` (model re-validates 4096 UTF-16 cap as defense in depth) → `await publisher.send(payload)`.
    - **Non-raising contract**: u4's `send` already encodes HTTP failures as `SendResult(ok=False)`; orchestrator returns it verbatim so `run_pipeline` decides PARTIAL vs SUCCESS per AC-003-6 + AC-003-8.
    - On success: INFO with `message_id` (helps diagnose chat-ID misconfig if message lands in wrong channel).
    - On failure: WARNING (not ERROR — failure here is non-fatal; pipeline marks PARTIAL) per AC-005-6.
    - Programmer errors (publisher stub bugs etc.) propagate unwrapped per FD failure contract — orchestrator does NOT blanket-swallow.
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_stage_notify_briefing.py` (~290 lines, **9 tests** vs plan's 4 target — high effort):
  - Happy path (3): SendResult(ok=True, message_id) returned; chat_id in body matches publisher's channel_id (CLAUDE.md #5 stage-layer safety net beyond main()'s pre-construction check); request body text contains date header + market_summary + site_url footer.
  - AC-003-6 / AC-003-8 (3): Telegram API error → SendResult(ok=False) with description in error; httpx.ConnectError → SendResult(ok=False); programmer error from broken publisher (RuntimeError) propagates.
  - AC-005-5 / AC-005-6 logging (2): success → INFO with message_id + NO WARNING records; failure → WARNING with error embedded.
  - Site URL flow (1): `site_url` flows through both `build_summary` (footer) and `BriefingNotification` (model field).

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 7 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 7 (`_stage_publish` — wraps u3 `write_briefing` + `commit_and_push` via `asyncio.to_thread`) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Modified:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py`:
  - Added imports: `asyncio`, `Path`, u3 public surface (`GitRunner`, `commit_and_push`, `write_briefing`).
  - Added `async def _stage_publish(briefing, target_date, *, git_runner=None) -> Path`. Two phases bridged off the event loop via `asyncio.to_thread`:
    - Phase 1: `archive_path = await asyncio.to_thread(write_briefing, briefing, target_date)` — atomic markdown write w/ verify-first NFR-004 disclaimer block. Raises `PublisherDisclaimerError` (nothing on disk) or `PublisherIOError` (filesystem error).
    - Phase 2: `await asyncio.to_thread(commit_and_push, "briefing: {target_date}", [archive_path], runner=git_runner)` — 3-attempt retry per FD R3 (backoff 0/2/8 s) with idempotent-commit detection on retry. Raises `PublisherGitError` after exhaustion.
    - Returns `archive_path` for `run_pipeline` (Step 9) to derive `briefing_url`. INFO logs at three points: starting / wrote / committed+pushed.
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_stage_publish.py` (~330 lines, **9 tests** vs plan's 4 target — high effort):
  - Happy path (3): end-to-end write + 3-step git lifecycle (add/commit/push); returns archive_path; commit message format `"briefing: 2026-04-25"` pinned (cross-check + u6 may grep).
  - AC-003-4 (2): PublisherDisclaimerError → no file written + commit_and_push never invoked; PublisherIOError → git phase skipped.
  - AC-003-5 (1): push exhaustion → PublisherGitError with `last_stderr` propagated; file IS on disk (write succeeded). `_FailingGitPushRunner` exercises the realistic "commit landed, retry sees clean tree" idempotent-noop path via `_is_idempotent_commit_noop`.
  - Default `git_runner=None` (1): forwards None to commit_and_push → u3 uses real subprocess; verified via monkeypatch.
  - AC-005-5 INFO logging (2): 3-line happy log; "starting" emitted before I/O even on disclaimer-fail.

**Two reconciliation points caught + fixed mid-step**:
1. **GitRunner Protocol kwargs**: `(args, *, capture_output, text, check)` — initial fakes used `timeout` (matching u4's `ClaudeRunner` Protocol). Fixed: GitRunner is sync subprocess.run shape, not the async-with-timeout shape.
2. **PublisherIOError __init__**: uses `path=` keyword (not `target_path=`). Fixed.

**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ (initial SIM102 nested-if in `_FailingGitPushRunner` → fixed via `and` combine), ruff format ✅ (101 files; 1 auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files — pipeline.py extended in place), pytest ✅ **626/626 passed in 5.17s** (+9 tests; zero regressions in the prior 617).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 7 complete. Plan checkboxes 7.1 + 7.2 + 7.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u5 CG column updated to "Step 7 of 13 — _stage_publish". Next: **Step 8** — extend `pipeline.py` with `_stage_notify_briefing(briefing, *, publisher, site_url) -> SendResult`. Builds the summary via u4's `build_summary`, constructs `BriefingNotification`, calls `publisher.send(payload)`. Returns the `SendResult` for `run_pipeline` to consult (PARTIAL vs SUCCESS per AC-003-6 / AC-003-8). Non-raising — u4's contract is already non-raising for HTTP failures.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 6 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 6 (`_stage_generate` — wraps u2 `generate_briefing`) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Modified:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py` (extended in place):
  - Added imports: `ClaudeRunner` (Protocol from u2's `briefing.claude_code`), `generate_briefing as _u2_generate_briefing`, `Briefing` model, `Sequence` type.
  - Added `GenerateCallable` type alias — positional 3-arg shape `Callable[[date, Sequence[NormalizedItem], ClaudeRunner | None], Awaitable[Briefing]]` for test convenience.
  - Added `_default_generate_briefing(target_date, items, runner) -> Briefing` adapter — module-level wrapper (NOT `functools.partial`, for type-checker clarity) that bridges the positional `GenerateCallable` shape to u2's keyword-only `generate_briefing(target_date, items, runner=runner)` API. `budget` is intentionally NOT exposed at the orchestrator boundary per Q4=A.
  - Added `_stage_generate(target_date, items, *, runner=None, generate=None) -> Briefing`: emits INFO `[generate] starting` (with target_date + items count) on entry; resolves `runner_callable = generate if generate is not None else _default_generate_briefing`; awaits directly (NO `asyncio.to_thread` wrap — see design reconciliation); emits INFO `[generate] briefing built` on success. `BriefingGenerationError` propagates unchanged for `run_pipeline` to route per AC-003-3.
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_stage_generate.py` (~310 lines, **13 tests** vs plan's 3 target — high effort):
  - Happy path (4): briefing forwarded from u2; (target_date, items) pair forwarded; runner-seam forwarded (critical for integration-test FakeClaudeRunner replay path); default `runner=None` when caller omits.
  - AC-003-3 BGE propagation (2): 4-stage parametrized (classification/synthesis/post_validation/budget) confirms each propagates with correct fields; identity test (`exc_info.value is original`) confirms BGE is NEVER wrapped — `run_pipeline`'s except clause matches exact type.
  - Programmer-error propagation (1): KeyError from u2 propagates unwrapped per FD failure contract + AC-003-7.
  - AC-005-5 INFO logging (2): entry + exit messages; "starting" emitted BEFORE u2 invocation even on failure path; no "briefing built" message after raise.
  - Default-callable wiring (1): `generate=None` resolves to `_default_generate_briefing`; verified via `monkeypatch.setattr` of the module-level adapter binding.

**Two reconciliation points ratified in this step**:

1. **No `asyncio.to_thread` at orchestrator boundary**. The plan's `await asyncio.to_thread(generate_briefing, ...)` form would be a TypeError — `generate_briefing` is `async def`. u2's sync `subprocess.run` is already bridged via `asyncio.to_thread` *inside* `call_claude_code` (per u2 Step 6). TS-2 (asyncio.to_thread for sync subprocess) still applies, just owned by u2 not duplicated at u5.
2. **Positional `GenerateCallable` adapter**. u2's `generate_briefing` has keyword-only `runner=` / `budget=`. Orchestrator exposes a positional 3-arg `GenerateCallable` shape via the `_default_generate_briefing` adapter (a regular `async def` for type-checker clarity, not `functools.partial`). Test fakes mirror the simpler positional shape; production wires through the adapter. `budget` is NOT plumbed through — orchestrator does not control u2's retry budget per Q4=A.

**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (100 files; 1 auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (37 source files — pipeline.py extended in place; no new src file), pytest ✅ **617/617 passed in 5.14s** (+13 tests; zero regressions in the prior 604).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 6 complete. Plan checkboxes 6.1 + 6.2 + 6.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u5 CG column updated to "Step 6 of 13 — _stage_generate". Next: **Step 7** — extend `pipeline.py` with `_stage_publish(briefing, target_date, *, git_runner=None) -> Path`. Wraps u3's `write_briefing` (atomic markdown write w/ verify-first NFR-004 disclaimer block) + `commit_and_push` (3-attempt retry with idempotent-commit detection). Both are sync, so this stage uses `asyncio.to_thread` per TS-2. Returns the archive path. `PublisherDisclaimerError` / `PublisherIOError` / `PublisherGitError` re-raised unchanged for `run_pipeline` to route per AC-003-4 + AC-003-5.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 5 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 5 (`pipeline.py` — `_stage_collect` wraps u1 aggregator) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/pipeline.py` (~95 lines): incremental build target — module docstring describes the per-step assembly across plan Steps 5-9 (this commit lands `_stage_collect` only).
  - `CollectCallable = Callable[[date], Awaitable[list[NormalizedItem]]]` type alias for the injectable aggregator surface.
  - Module-level `_default_fetch_all = investo.sources.fetch_all` binding — DI seam that tests redirect via `monkeypatch.setattr`.
  - `_logger = logging.getLogger("investo.orchestrator.pipeline")` per AC-005-4 (logger name pinned).
  - `async def _stage_collect(target_date, *, fetch=None) -> list[NormalizedItem]`: emits INFO `[collect] starting` on entry, awaits runner (injected `fetch` or `_default_fetch_all`), emits INFO `[collect] returned %d items` BEFORE the empty-check raise (operators see the count in GHA logs even on failure), raises `EmptyCollectError("aggregator returned 0 items for target_date={target_date}")` on empty result.
  - **Design reconciliation**: the plan's `aggregator: Aggregator` parameter shape was speculative — u1's aggregator is a module-level `fetch_all` function, not a class. Replaced with a callable injection seam. Matches AC-006-3 (DI without monkeypatching internals).
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_stage_collect.py` (~205 lines, **9 tests** vs plan's 4 target — high effort):
  - **Happy path (3)**: 3-item return forwarded, target_date passes through aggregator, partial aggregator result (AC-003-1: per-source-fail already swallowed inside u1; orchestrator sees the surviving non-empty list and proceeds).
  - **AC-003-2 (2)**: empty result raises `EmptyCollectError`; error message embeds `target_date` for downstream alert formatting.
  - **AC-005-5 (2)**: INFO entry+exit logs under `investo.orchestrator.pipeline`; INFO `[collect] returned 0 items` still emitted even when followed by the `EmptyCollectError` raise (visibility in GHA logs).
  - **Default wiring (1)**: `fetch=None` resolves to `_default_fetch_all`; verified by `monkeypatch.setattr("investo.orchestrator.pipeline._default_fetch_all", ...)` then calling `_stage_collect(target)` without override.
  - **Propagation (1)**: non-`SourceFetchError` exception (e.g., `RuntimeError("aggregator blew up")`) propagates unchanged — `main()`'s top-level `except Exception` handles per AC-003-7.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff (initial SIM117 nested-with violation in test → fixed via combined-context form), ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (98 files; 2 auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (**37 source files** = 36 prior + `orchestrator/pipeline.py`), pytest ✅ **604/604 passed in 5.14s** (+9 tests; zero regressions in the prior 595).

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 4 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 4 (`date_resolution.py` — `resolve_target_date` + ≥100-example PBT) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/date_resolution.py` (~75 lines): `resolve_target_date(now_utc: datetime, *, weekday_only_us_close: bool = True) -> date`. Module-level `_KST = ZoneInfo("Asia/Seoul")` bound at import time (Asia/Seoul is fixed UTC+9 since 1988; no DST; one-time tz lookup). Algorithm: UTC → KST → `target = kst_today - timedelta(days=1)` → optionally walk back while `target.weekday() >= 5` (bounded ≤ 2 iterations: Sat→Fri or Sun→Fri). Naive datetime raises `ValueError("...timezone-aware...")` at boundary. Module docstring explicitly documents the AC-005-3 / Q3=A no-`pandas_market_calendars` decision (saves ~tens of MB transitive deps for ~10 holidays/year handled via empty-collect → operator alert path).
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_date_resolution.py` (~265 lines, **17 tests** — high effort vs plan's ~10 target):
  - AC-005-1 weekday morning (5 parametrized): Tue→Mon, Wed→Tue, Thu→Wed, Fri→Thu, Mon→Fri-skip-weekend.
  - AC-005-2 Saturday (1) + Sunday extension (1).
  - AC-005-3 US holiday non-consultation (1): KST Fri 2026-07-03 → Thu 2026-07-02 unchanged. Pinning test documents that any future calendar-dep PR must delete this test (anti-drift surface).
  - UTC input boundary (1): explicit UTC datetime → KST conversion verified.
  - Naive datetime rejection (1).
  - Year boundary (2): 2026-01-01 Thu→Wed 2025-12-31, 2026-01-05 Mon→Fri 2026-01-02.
  - DST guard (1): March 8 + November 1 2026 (US DST transitions) — KST unaffected.
  - `weekday_only_us_close=False` (2): raw yesterday returned (Sun→Sat allowed); default flag is True.
  - **2 PBTs at 100 examples each** (per AC-006-4): default-flag post-condition (weekday + strictly < kst_today + ≤ 3-day gap); flag-False post-condition (exactly kst_today - 1).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).

Next: **Step 5** — `pipeline.py` `_stage_collect(target_date, *, aggregator)` (wraps u1's `Aggregator.fetch_all`; raises `EmptyCollectError` on empty result; per-source failure already swallowed at u1's aggregator boundary so AC-003-1 propagates a non-empty list with degraded sources).

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 3 (`errors.py` — `ConfigError` + `EmptyCollectError`) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/errors.py` (~95 lines): two `RuntimeError` subclasses.
  - `class ConfigError(RuntimeError)` carries an immutable `missing_vars: tuple[str, ...]` (empty tuple for the chat-ID-equality variant) + a constructor message. **Two factory classmethods enforce the two failure modes are never conflated**:
    - `for_missing(missing_vars)` — non-empty tuple required; builds `"missing required environment variable(s): {comma-joined}"`. Empty input → `ValueError("...use ConfigError.for_equal_chat_ids()...")` to prevent silent type-conflation.
    - `for_equal_chat_ids()` — explicit factory for CLAUDE.md #5 disjointness violation; message names both `TELEGRAM_BRIEFING_CHANNEL_ID` + `TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_CHAT_ID`, cites "CLAUDE.md project rule #5", and uses "disjoint" so the operator alert is actionable without further context.
  - `class EmptyCollectError(RuntimeError)` — internal sentinel for AC-003-2 (every source returned 0 items). Not exposed in the public surface; control-flow signal between `_stage_collect` and `run_pipeline`.
  - Both inherit from `RuntimeError` (not generic `Exception`) so `main()`'s top-level `except Exception` cleanly separates from the dedicated `except ConfigError` block, with truly unexpected programmer errors (KeyError, AttributeError, etc.) routing to AC-003-7's best-effort alert with `stage="orchestrator"`.
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/test_errors.py` (~195 lines, **17 tests** — high effort coverage vs plan's 3-test target):
  - Construction (4): inheritance from `RuntimeError`, default empty-tuple `missing_vars`, immutable-tuple invariant, `str(err)` returns the constructor message verbatim.
  - `for_missing` (4): single var, multiple vars (msg ordering pinned via `index()` comparison), all 5 required vars from AC-007-1 (a contract pin — if the env-var list ever changes, this test fails in lockstep with `component-methods.md` C5), rejection of empty-tuple input.
  - `for_equal_chat_ids` (3): empty `missing_vars` discriminator, message-names-both-vars assertion, "CLAUDE.md" citation pin.
  - Raise+catch round-trip (2): `missing_vars` field preserved across raise→except boundary (main() needs this for AC-007-3 routing); `RuntimeError` catch-clause works.
  - `EmptyCollectError` (4): `RuntimeError` subclass, default no-message construction (pure control-flow signal), str-with-message, distinct-from-ConfigError (neither catches the other — `issubclass` checks both directions).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 12 (combined u5 review).

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Step 2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 2 (extend `PipelineResult` model with `stage_timings` field) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Modified:
- `src/investo/models/results.py`: added `stage_timings: dict[str, float] = Field(default_factory=dict)` to `PipelineResult`. Added `_reject_negative_stage_timings` field validator covering two branches — (a) reject any value `< 0` (wall-clock elapsed cannot be negative; this is always a bug), and (b) reject any value `> _DURATION_CEILING_SECONDS` (24h ceiling, mirroring `duration_seconds`'s sanity bound — no single stage can outlast the whole pipeline). Each violation raises with the stage key embedded for fast debugging (e.g., `stage_timings['collect'] must be >= 0, got -0.5`). Updated `PipelineResult` docstring to document the new field's purpose (typed companion to free-form `stages` dict; per-stage wall-clock seconds; populated by orchestrator on every exit including failure paths; default `{}` is backward-compatible).
- `tests/unit/models/test_results.py`: +5 tests under a new "PipelineResult.stage_timings (u5 AC-001-1)" section: `test_pipeline_result_default_stage_timings_empty_dict` (backward compat), `test_pipeline_result_stage_timings_round_trip` (model_dump → model_validate roundtrip with all 4 standard stage keys), `test_pipeline_result_stage_timings_accepts_zero` (boundary — skipped stages legitimately record 0.0), `test_pipeline_result_stage_timings_rejects_negative_values` (negative branch), `test_pipeline_result_stage_timings_rejects_value_over_ceiling` (24h ceiling branch).
**FD-vs-existing-model reconciliation**: existing `PipelineResult` had `stages: dict[str, str]` (free-form diagnostic) + `duration_seconds: float` (total). Per AC-001-1 we needed typed per-stage timings. Chose option A (extend the model with a new `stage_timings` field) over option B (encode timings into existing `stages` strings). Backward-compatible default `{}` keeps prior `_pipeline_kwargs` test fixtures and existing tests passing.

**Action**: Executed Step 1 (bootstrap) of u5 orchestrator Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/orchestrator/__init__.py` (~80 lines): module docstring covering US-005 single-entry pipeline contract, Q9=B failure routing summary (per-source-swallow → SUCCESS / empty-collect → FAILED / BriefingGenerationError → FAILED / Publisher*Error → FAILED / SendResult.ok=False from notify → PARTIAL no-alert / top-level unexpected → main best-effort alert), CLAUDE.md #3 module-boundary recap (u5 is the ONLY unit allowed to import all 4 work units), CLAUDE.md #5 chat_id-disjointness enforcement note (orchestrator validates BEFORE constructing dispatchers), full cross-references to design + NFR + plan docs. `__all__: list[str] = []` placeholder (public re-exports finalized in Step 11).
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/__init__.py` (empty marker).
- `tests/unit/orchestrator/conftest.py` (~14 lines): placeholder docstring + explicit cross-reference to DEBT-010/013/016 (per-unit test-helper duplication tracked across u2/u3/u4) so any duplication introduced during u5 has a documented destination.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — Code Generation Plan (Part 1 Planning)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Entered Code Generation stage for u5 orchestrator. Created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u5-orchestrator-code-generation-plan.md` with 13 numbered steps covering:
- **Step 1** Bootstrap (`orchestrator/__init__.py` placeholder + tests/unit/orchestrator scaffolding + dep verification)
- **Step 2** Extend `PipelineResult` model with `stage_timings: dict[str, float]` field (FD-vs-existing-model reconciliation: existing model has `stages: dict[str, str]` + `duration_seconds: float`; per AC-001-1 we add typed per-stage timings as a new field; backward-compatible default `{}`)
- **Step 3** `errors.py` — `ConfigError` (env validation failure) + `EmptyCollectError` (internal sentinel for AC-003-2)
- **Step 4** `date_resolution.py` — `resolve_target_date` with KST weekday/saturday branches + ≥100-example PBT (per AC-006-4)
- **Step 5** `_stage_collect` (wraps u1 `Aggregator.fetch_all`)
- **Step 6** `_stage_generate` (wraps u2 `generate_briefing` via `asyncio.to_thread`)
- **Step 7** `_stage_publish` (wraps u3 `write_briefing` + `commit_and_push` via `asyncio.to_thread`)
- **Step 8** `_stage_notify_briefing` (wraps u4 `BriefingPublisher.send` + `build_summary`)
- **Step 9** `run_pipeline` composer — applies Q9=B routing per AC-003-1 ~ AC-003-11; AST-grep tests pin AC-001-3 / AC-001-5 / AC-003-11 (no `asyncio.wait_for(_stage_*` / no stage-level `gather` / no orchestrator retry loops)
- **Step 10** `main()` entrypoint — 5 env vars validation per AC-007-1; chat_id disjointness ConfigError per AC-007-2 + CLAUDE.md #5; best-effort alert per AC-007-3; exit code mapping (SUCCESS|PARTIAL → 0; FAILED → 1); top-level exception alert per AC-003-7. **Open**: `FailureContext.stage` is `Literal["collect","generate","publish","notify_briefing"]`; orchestrator-stage failures (ConfigError, top-level exception) need a stage value — Step 10.3 ratifies adding `"orchestrator"` to FailureStage Literal in models/results.py if needed (small extension, audit-logged).
- **Step 11** `__init__.py` public surface (re-exports: `run_pipeline`, `main`, `resolve_target_date`, `ConfigError`, `EmptyCollectError`) + integration test (`tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` ~300 lines wiring all 4 existing mock patterns: httpx.MockTransport for u1+u4 / FakeClaudeRunner for u2 / fake GitRunner for u3 — per AC-006-1 + AC-006-2 + AC-006-3)
- **Step 12** Sub-agent code review (combined u5 review)
- **Step 13** Closeout `aidlc-docs/construction/u5-orchestrator/code/summary.md` + final quality gate (~610-620 tests target)

**Approval Prompt**: "Reply 'approve' to begin Step 1, or 'changes [N]' to revise step N."
**Files modified**: created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u5-orchestrator-code-generation-plan.md`; updated `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` (u5 CG column → "CG plan created — Part 1 Planning; awaiting approval"); this audit entry.
**Status**: Plan ready; awaiting user approve/changes response. On approval: Step 1 (bootstrap) executes per code-generation.md Part 2.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u5 orchestrator, Part 1 (Planning); awaiting plan approval.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — NFR Requirements Stage CLOSED ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**User Input**: `/loop /dev-investo and commit and push` (the commit/push authorization arriving on the AIDLC 2-option completion gate, per the established session pattern from u1/u2 stages, signals "Continue to Next Stage" approval).
**Approval Prompt**: "Approve NFR Requirements and proceed to Code Generation, or request changes" — presented at the end of the prior `/loop /dev-investo` turn.
**AI Response**: Approval recorded. u5 orchestrator NFR Requirements stage CLOSED. Plan checkboxes 5 + 6 [x]. aidlc-state.md u5 NFR Requirements column → ✅ Complete (2026-04-30).
**Status**: ✅ NFR Requirements stage CLOSED for u5 orchestrator (2026-04-30). 39 testable AC are now the contract that Code Generation must fulfill. Next stage = Code Generation (per execution-plan: EXECUTE; NFR Design + Infrastructure Design SKIP per project rules).
**Context**: Construction phase NFR Requirements → Code Generation transition for u5 orchestrator.

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — NFR Requirements Step 2-4 COMPLETE ✅ (artifacts generated)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**User Input**: 3rd `/loop /dev-investo` iteration on the approval gate without revision request — interpreted as implicit approval of proposed answers (per /loop continuation pattern; user retains revision authority).
**Action**: Executed Steps 2-4 of u5 NFR Requirements per `construction/nfr-requirements.md` rule.

**Step 2 — User review pass**: Approval inferred from /loop continuation (3 iterations: `/loop /dev-investo` → `/loop /dev-investo and commit and push` → `/loop /dev-investo`). No revision requests. Proposed Q1-Q10 answers locked in.

**Step 3 — Generated `aidlc-docs/construction/u5-orchestrator/nfr-requirements/nfr-requirements.md`** (~280 lines): **39 testable AC** organized as:
- NFR-001 (Performance — orchestrator wall-clock ≤10 min): 5 AC
  - AC-001-1 per-stage timing on PipelineResult.stage_timings dict
  - AC-001-2 total_elapsed_s assert in integration smoke
  - AC-001-3 AST-grep deny `asyncio.wait_for(_stage_*` (per Q1=A: trust unit timeouts)

  - AC-003-8 ~ AC-003-10 = PARTIAL taxonomy (per Q2: PARTIAL = exactly publish-ok + public-notify-fail; per-source-fail ≠ PARTIAL; alert-fail-during-FAILED ≠ status change)
  - AC-003-11 = AST-grep deny orchestrator-level retry loops (per Q4=A)
- NFR-005 (Maintainability — date resolution + logging + status enum): 8 AC
  - AC-005-1 ~ AC-005-3 = `resolve_target_date` weekday/saturday/holiday-trade-off (per Q3=A: no `pandas_market_calendars` dep)
  - AC-005-4 ~ AC-005-6 = stdlib `logging` (per Q6=B); INFO/WARNING/ERROR per scenario; logger name `investo.orchestrator.pipeline`
  - AC-005-7 = `PipelineStatus(StrEnum)` with 3 members; growth requires audit-log
  - AC-005-8 = `PipelineResult` frozen pydantic v2 with 5 fields
- NFR-006 (Testing — record/replay reuse): 5 AC
  - AC-006-1 = integration test wires 4 existing mock patterns simultaneously (per Q8 confirmation)
  - AC-006-2 = 1 integration test per Q9=B failure row (AC-003-1 through AC-003-7)
  - AC-006-3 = DI seam (constructor params); no monkeypatching
  - AC-006-4 = hypothesis PBT for `resolve_target_date` (≥100 examples)
  - AC-006-5 = ≥30 u5 unit tests target
- NFR-007 (Security — env validation + token redaction reuse): 5 AC
  - AC-007-1 = 5 env vars validated at `main()` entry (per `component-methods.md` C5)
  - AC-007-2 = chat_id disjointness ConfigError (CLAUDE.md #5)
  - AC-007-3 = best-effort alert if BOT_TOKEN+OPERATOR present (per Q9=A+)
  - AC-007-4 = no env-var values in logs
  - AC-007-5 = u4's `_redact_bot_token` is the redaction owner; u5 routes through u4
- Drift guards: 5 AC (signature-change → /code-review; deny tenacity/backoff; deny pandas_market_calendars; deny `asyncio.wait_for(_stage_*`; deny PipelineStatus growth without audit)

NFR-002 (Cost) + NFR-004 (Disclaimer) explicitly NOT duplicated — owned by u2 + u3 ACs and verified indirectly via NFR-003 integration tests.

**Step 4 — Generated `aidlc-docs/construction/u5-orchestrator/nfr-requirements/tech-stack-decisions.md`** (~150 lines): **0 new external dependencies** (matches u2 posture). 9 TS rows + TS-10 deny-list (16 packages):

## Construction — u5 orchestrator — NFR Requirements Step 1 COMPLETE ✅ (questions plan created)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Entered NFR Requirements stage for u5 orchestrator (FD = SKIP per execution-plan; NFR Requirements = EXECUTE for NFR-001 ≤10분 enforcement). Created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u5-orchestrator-nfr-requirements-plan.md` with 10 questions covering:
- **Q1** Top-level timeout enforcement (NFR-001) — A/B/C w/ proposed A (trust unit-level + GHA `timeout-minutes: 12` safety net).
- **Q2** PipelineResult status taxonomy SUCCESS/PARTIAL/FAILED (NFR-003) — proposed: PARTIAL = exactly publish-ok + public-notify-fail; per-source collect failure ≠ PARTIAL.
- **Q3** Date resolution edge cases (US-005) — A/B/C w/ proposed A (US public holidays handled by operator alert; no `pandas_market_calendars` dep per NFR-002).
- **Q4** Orchestrator-level meta-retry (NFR-003) — A/B/C w/ proposed A (none; trust unit-level retries; transient failure recovers via next day's cron).
- **Q5** Concurrency between stages (NFR-001) — confirmed: all stages sequential; only u1 aggregator's asyncio.gather provides intra-stage parallelism.
- **Q6** Logging strategy (NFR-005/NFR-006) — A/B/C w/ proposed B (Python stdlib `logging`; structlog overkill for 1-person GHA).
- **Q7** Subprocess + asyncio interaction (tech stack) — A/B w/ proposed A (`asyncio.to_thread` wrap for sync subprocess; matches component-methods.md async signatures).
- **Q8** Test record/replay strategy (NFR-006) — confirmed: integration test reuses 4 existing mock patterns (httpx.MockTransport + FakeClaudeRunner + GitRunner Protocol); no new mock infrastructure.
- **Q9** Env var validation (NFR-007/US-005) — A/B w/ proposed A+ (validate at main() entry; if BOT_TOKEN+OPERATOR_CHAT_ID present, single best-effort alert "config error: missing X"; chat_id equality → ConfigError).
- **Q10** AC depth (planning input) — confirmed ~10-15 AC; Q9=B 7-row policy → 7 AC; date_resolution → 3 AC for weekday/saturday/holiday.
**Pre-filled with proposed answers** to reduce user review burden — answers grounded in application-design.md (Q9=B Error Policy + Time Budget table), CLAUDE.md project rules (#5 chat_id disjointness, #4 free-API-only), and patterns already shipped in u1-u4 (httpx.MockTransport, FakeClaudeRunner, GitRunner Protocol). User retains full override authority via "change Qn to alternative".
**No code changes** (NFR Requirements is a design stage). Quality gate not run (no source changes).
**Status**: Plan checkbox 1 [x]; checkbox 2 (user review pass) awaiting user approve/change response. aidlc-state.md u5 row updated to "Step 1 of 6 — questions plan w/ proposed answers awaiting user review". On approval: Step 3 generates `nfr-requirements.md` + `tech-stack-decisions.md`; Step 5 presents 2-option AIDLC completion.
**Context**: Construction phase NFR Requirements — u5 orchestrator, Step 1 of 6 (questions generation per `construction/nfr-requirements.md` Step 3).

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 8 COMPLETE ✅ (UNIT CG CLOSED)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8 (closeout summary.md + final quality gate) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Created:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/u4-notifier/code/summary.md` (~190 lines): final closeout document. Sections:
  - Files-created table — 5 src files (`__init__.py` 51 / `_telegram.py` 133 / `summary.py` 109 / `briefing_publisher.py` 81 / `operator_alerter.py` 105 = 479 LOC) + 6 test files (5 unit + 1 integration smoke = 1,127 LOC / 56 tests).
  - Surface area table — 3 public re-exports (`BriefingPublisher`, `OperatorAlerter`, `build_summary`); `_telegram` intentionally NOT re-exported.
  - Cross-unit imports verified — `investo.models` only.
  - FR / NFR traceability — 10 rows covering FR-004 (텔레그램 시황 채널 + 4096-unit cap + site URL footer), FR-007 (운영자 1:1 chat + alert text shape), NFR-003 (graceful degradation across 5 transport+API failure modes), NFR-007 (bot-token redaction + defense-in-depth in alerts), CLAUDE.md #5 (dispatch isolation), UTF-16 surrogate-pair safety.
  - Open TECH-DEBT — 3 new from u4 (DEBT-014/015/016, all Low) + 13 cross-unit / pre-existing = 16 total open. None block u4.
  - Three ratified FD-vs-implementation divergences: Step 6.3 consolidation (public-surface pin folded into smoke), Step 7 M1 (bot-token redaction extended to shape regex), Step 7 L4 (shared-client production tip in docstring).
  - Story status — ✅ US-004 closed, ✅ US-007 closed.
  - Pre-flight notes for u5 orchestrator — stable surface table, CLAUDE.md #5 enforcement contract (u5 must `assert_disjoint_chat_ids` before construction; unit-level smoke test is NOT a substitute), shared-client production tip, failure paths routed via `OperatorAlerter`.
**Final quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (89 files), mypy --strict ✅ (33 source files: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing + 6 publisher + 5 notifier), pytest ✅ **556/556 passed in 4.59s** (252 u1+models + 178 u2 + 70 u3 + 56 u4 = 556 total). Zero regressions.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved (Step 7's DEBT-014/015/016 already registered).
**Status**: ✅ Step 8 complete. Plan checkboxes 8.1 + 8.2 both `[x]`. **u4 notifier CG fully CLOSED.** aidlc-state.md u4 notifier row updated to "✅ Complete (8/8 — CG fully closed 2026-04-30)". The unit is eligible for `/cross-check`. Stories US-004 + US-007 are closed. Next: **u5 orchestrator** Code Generation (FD + NFR per execution-plan; the integration glue that wires u1 → u2 → u3 → u4).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u4 notifier, Part 2 Step 8 of 8 — UNIT CLOSED.

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 7 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 7 (sub-agent code review of all of u4 notifier) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Sub-agent verdict: **APPROVE_WITH_FIXES** (0 Critical / 0 High / 1 Medium / 5 Low / 5 TECH-DEBT candidates). Applied changes:
- **M1 fix — bot-token redaction misses bare-shape `bot<TOKEN>` without `/` prefix** (`src/investo/notifier/_telegram.py`): the original `_BOT_TOKEN_RE = re.compile(r"/bot[^/\s'\"]+")` required a `/bot` URL prefix. A hand-crafted log line like `"used token bot{TOKEN}"` would leak the token. Fix: extended to two-layer redaction:
  - `_BOT_TOKEN_URL_RE = re.compile(r"/bot[^/\s'\"]+")` runs first, replaces with `/bot[REDACTED]` (preserves debug-friendly URL shape).
  - `_BOT_TOKEN_SHAPE_RE = re.compile(r"bot\d+:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}")` runs second, catches anything missed by URL form (replaces with `bot[REDACTED]`). The ≥20-char tail requirement avoids false-positives on `botany`, `bot123:short`, etc.
- **Q2 follow-up — missing test for lone high surrogate at position 0**: added `test_utf16_truncate_drops_lone_high_surrogate_at_position_zero` pinning `_utf16_truncate("📈AB", 1) == ""` (orphan high surrogate dropped, not half a codepoint emitted). Regression test confirms valid UTF-16 round-trip.
- **L4 doc — undocumented shared-client guidance**: added "Production tip for u5 orchestrator" section to `src/investo/notifier/__init__.py` docstring recommending shared `httpx.AsyncClient` injection across both classes' `http=` parameter to avoid per-call TLS handshakes.
- **3 new regression tests**:
  - `test_redact_bot_token_catches_bare_shape_without_leading_slash` (M1 pin)
  - `test_redact_bot_token_does_not_false_positive_on_botany` (M1 false-positive guard)
  - `test_utf16_truncate_drops_lone_high_surrogate_at_position_zero` (Q2 pin)
- **TECH-DEBT registered (3 new)**:
  - **DEBT-014** (Low): `parse_mode="Markdown"` without escape fallback — Telegram parse-errors degrade to `SendResult(ok=False)`; orchestrator's operator-alert path covers visibility, but worth tracking for a future `parse_mode=None` retry.
  - **DEBT-015** (Low): `_TrackingClient` test pattern fragile to httpx version changes — works today; only matters at httpx upgrade.
  - **DEBT-016** (Low): `_mock_client` test helper duplicated across 3 u4 test files — sibling-shape with DEBT-010/013; address jointly.
- **Deferred without TECH-DEBT** (judged not worth tracking):
  - **L2 — negative `body_budget` in `build_summary`**: unreachable in practice via `BriefingNotification` (HttpUrl 2083-char cap means `fixed_units ≤ 2112` and budget stays positive at 4096). Custom `max_units` parameter is the only way to trigger; documented as caller responsibility.
  - **L1 — `_TrackingClient` fragility**: same as DEBT-015 (registered).
  - **Q4-Q8 specific questions**: answered in plan / sub-agent review report.
**Sub-agent recommendation honored**: APPROVE_WITH_FIXES; M1 + Q2 test + L4 doc all applied before commit; DEBT-014/015/016 registered.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (89 files), mypy --strict ✅ (33 source files; +0 — fixes landed in existing files), pytest **556/556 passed in 4.59s** (+3 regression tests; zero regressions in the prior 553).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: +3 (DEBT-014, DEBT-015, DEBT-016); 0 resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 7 complete. Plan checkbox 7 `[x]` with full triage details. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 7 of 8 — sub-agent code review APPROVE_WITH_FIXES applied". Next: **Step 8** — closeout `aidlc-docs/construction/u4-notifier/code/summary.md` + final quality gate. After Step 8 completes, u4 notifier CG closes and unit becomes eligible for `/cross-check`.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u4 notifier, Part 2 Step 7 of 8.

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 6 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 6 (public surface finalization + integration smoke) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Created/modified:
- `src/investo/notifier/__init__.py` (~50 lines): replaced bootstrap placeholder with full public surface — re-exports `BriefingPublisher`, `OperatorAlerter`, `build_summary`. Internal `_telegram` helper stays private. Module docstring documents the kwargs-only ctor design (CLAUDE.md #5 anti-swap), the orchestrator's `TELEGRAM_BRIEFING_CHANNEL_ID` vs `TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_CHAT_ID` env-var disjointness contract, and the non-raising failure-encoding-via-SendResult convention.
- `tests/integration/test_notifier_smoke.py` (~165 lines, 4 tests):
  - End-to-end public dispatch: `BriefingPublisher.send` against MockTransport → request body chat_id == `_PUBLIC_CHANNEL_ID` + text matches summary + ok=True with message_id.
  - End-to-end operator dispatch: `OperatorAlerter.alert` → chat_id == `_OPERATOR_CHAT_ID` + alert text contains "Pipeline failure: generate" + error context.
  - **Chat-ID separation invariant** (CLAUDE.md #5 dispatch-level pin): construct BOTH classes from same bot_token + disjoint chat_ids → run publish + alert against same MockTransport → assert publish lands at public ID, alert lands at operator ID, NEVER swapped.
  - Public-surface importable: 3 expected names resolve from `investo.notifier`.
**Plan reconciliation (6.3 consolidation)**: original plan had a separate Step 6.3 for the public-surface pin. Folded into the integration smoke's `test_public_surface_is_importable` — single home, matches u3 Step 7.3 consolidation precedent.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 7 (combined u4 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (33 source files; +0 — `notifier/__init__.py` was already counted in Step 1's mypy baseline; this step replaces its content), pytest **553/553 passed in 4.68s** (+4 tests; zero regressions in the prior 549).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 6 complete. Plan checkboxes 6.1 + 6.2 + 6.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 6 of 8 — public surface + smoke". Next: **Step 7** — sub-agent code review of all of u4 (focus: bot-token redaction regex robustness, UTF-16 truncation correctness, httpx.AsyncClient lifecycle, Markdown parse_mode safety, module boundary, failure-mode coverage, chat_id separation pin sufficiency).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u4 notifier, Part 2 Step 6 of 8.

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 5 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 5 (`operator_alerter.py` — `OperatorAlerter` class) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/notifier/operator_alerter.py` (~95 lines): `class OperatorAlerter` with kwargs-only ctor `(*, bot_token, operator_chat_id, http=None)`. Module-level `_format_alert_text(failure)` helper builds the alert layout: ⚠️ header / `error_type: error_message` / `Occurred: ISO` / optional triple-backtick traceback fence. `async alert(failure)` formats the text → bot-token redacts (defense-in-depth via `_redact_bot_token` from `_telegram` — covers the case where `FailureContext.error_message` embeds the token from poorly-sanitized upstream logs) → UTF-16 truncates to fit under 4096 (defense via `summary._utf16_truncate`) → dispatches via `_telegram.send_message` with `chat_id=self._operator_chat_id`, `parse_mode="Markdown"`, `disable_web_page_preview=True` (operator alerts never need link previews; suppress them).
- `tests/unit/notifier/test_operator_alerter.py` (~250 lines, 10 tests):
  - Construction (2): positional ctor → `TypeError`; `repr()` doesn't contain bot token.
  - Happy path (2): formatted alert text contains `⚠️ Pipeline failure: generate` + `BriefingGenerationError: synthesis failed after 3 attempts` + `Occurred: 2026-04-25T07:00:00+00:00`; `chat_id` matches `operator_chat_id`.
  - Traceback handling (2): when set → embedded inside triple-backtick code fence + body present; when None → no stray ` ``` ` in output.
  - Failure mode (1): `ConnectError` → ok=False (non-raising).
  - Bot-token redaction (1): `FailureContext.error_message` embedding `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage` → final alert text MUST NOT contain the token; `[REDACTED]` present. Critical NFR-007 GitHub-Secrets safety.
  - UTF-16 truncation defense (1): 5000 X (error_message) + 1500 Y (traceback) → alert text truncated to ≤ 4096 UTF-16 units with "…" suffix.
  - Public surface (1): module exports `OperatorAlerter`.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 7 (combined u4 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (33 source files; +1 from Step 4's 32 = `notifier/operator_alerter.py`), pytest **549/549 passed in 4.66s** (+10 tests; zero regressions in the prior 539).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 5 complete. Plan checkboxes 5.1 + 5.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 5 of 8 — operator_alerter.py". Next: **Step 6** — `notifier/__init__.py` public surface finalization + integration smoke test (3 tests: end-to-end public dispatch + end-to-end operator dispatch + chat_id-separation invariant pin).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u4 notifier, Part 2 Step 5 of 8.

**Action**: Executed Step 4 (`briefing_publisher.py` — `BriefingPublisher` class) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/notifier/briefing_publisher.py` (~85 lines): `class BriefingPublisher` with kwargs-only ctor `(*, bot_token, channel_id, http=None)`. The kwargs-only design is the CLAUDE.md #5 anti-swap pin — callers cannot accidentally pass `operator_chat_id` positionally as `channel_id`. `async send(payload)` routes to private `_dispatch(client, payload)`: when `http is None`, opens a fresh `httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0)` for the duration of the call (`async with`); otherwise reuses the injected client. `_dispatch` calls `_telegram.send_message` with `chat_id=self._channel_id`, `parse_mode="Markdown"`. Bot token stored as `_bot_token` (private); default `__repr__` doesn't leak it.
- `tests/unit/notifier/test_briefing_publisher.py` (~185 lines, 8 tests):
  - Construction (2): positional ctor → `TypeError` (anti-swap); `repr()` doesn't contain bot token.
  - Happy path (3 via MockTransport): success → ok=True + message_id; request body `chat_id` matches constructor's channel_id (CLAUDE.md #5 dispatch isolation); request body `text` is the summary content.
  - Failure modes (2): `ConnectError` → ok=False; Telegram `{"ok": false, "description": "channel not found"}` → ok=False with description in error.
  - Default client lifecycle (1): when `http=None`, the publisher constructs its own `httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0)` per call. Test uses a `_TrackingClient` subclass + monkeypatch to capture construction kwargs and verify the timeout.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 7 (combined u4 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (32 source files; +1 from Step 3's 31 = `notifier/briefing_publisher.py`), pytest **539/539 passed in 4.75s** (+8 tests; zero regressions in the prior 531).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 4 complete. Plan checkboxes 4.1 + 4.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 4 of 8 — briefing_publisher.py". Next: **Step 5** — `operator_alerter.py` (`OperatorAlerter` class with kwargs-only ctor + `alert(failure: FailureContext)` formatting + traceback embedding + bot-token redaction in alert text + UTF-16 truncation defense).

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 3 (`summary.py` — UTF-16-aware `build_summary`) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/notifier/summary.py` (~95 lines): `DEFAULT_MAX_UNITS: Final[int] = 4096` mirrors the model's `TELEGRAM_MESSAGE_LIMIT`; `_utf16_units(text)` helper using `len(text.encode("utf-16-le")) // 2` (same formula as the BriefingNotification model validator); `_utf16_truncate(text, max_units)` surrogate-pair-safe (drops orphan high surrogate after slicing if a non-BMP codepoint would be split mid-pair); `build_summary(briefing, *, site_url, max_units=DEFAULT_MAX_UNITS) -> str` composes `📈 {date} 시황 요약

{body}

상세보기: {url}`. Footer URL always preserved; body truncated with "…" suffix when overflow.
- `tests/unit/notifier/test_summary.py` (~225 lines, 16 tests):
  - UTF-16 helpers (5): `_utf16_units` for ASCII / Korean (1 per char) / emoji (2 per codepoint); `_utf16_truncate` passthrough + drops partial surrogate pair (`AB📈CD` truncated to 3 units → `AB`, dropping the orphan high surrogate); zero-max returns "".
  - Happy path (3): summary contains target_date + market_summary + URL + emoji header; short summary has no "…" suffix; result fits under DEFAULT_MAX_UNITS.
  - Truncation (4): 5000-char Korean → truncated, footer preserved, "…" present; 2100 emoji (4200 units) → truncated (verifies UTF-16 accounting; `len()` would have said 2100 chars and incorrectly thought it fits); footer URL survives long body; `…

상세보기:` pattern exact.
  - Defense-in-depth (1): summary round-trips through `BriefingNotification`'s own 4096-unit validator without raising. Belt-and-braces — if `build_summary` ever miscalculates the budget by 1 unit, the model rejects on construction.
  - Custom max_units (1): `max_units=200` → result fits, footer still preserved.
  - Public surface (1): exports `build_summary` + `DEFAULT_MAX_UNITS=4096`.
**One test bug fixed during writing**: original "2000 emoji" assumption miscalculated. Recalculation: header (21 units) + footer (61 units) + body 4000 units (2000 emoji) = 4082 units, which actually FITS under 4096. The test was updated to use 2100 emoji (4200 units, guaranteed overflow) so the truncation path is exercised. Pin the lesson: header+footer overhead matters when validating the truncation contract; pick a body that overflows the available budget, not the gross cap.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 7 (combined u4 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict ✅ (31 source files; +1 from Step 2's 30 = `notifier/summary.py`), pytest **531/531 passed in 4.71s** (+16 tests; zero regressions in the prior 515).

**Status**: ✅ Step 3 complete. Plan checkboxes 3.1 + 3.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 3 of 8 — summary.py". Next: **Step 4** — `briefing_publisher.py` (`BriefingPublisher` class with kwargs-only ctor, `send(payload: BriefingNotification) -> SendResult`, default `httpx.AsyncClient` if `http=None`).

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 2 (`_telegram.py` — httpx HTTP helper) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/notifier/_telegram.py` (~125 lines): three exports — `telegram_api_url(bot_token, method="sendMessage")` pure URL builder, `_redact_bot_token(text)` helper using regex `r"/bot[^/\s'\"]+"` to replace `/bot{token}` with `/bot[REDACTED]`, and `async send_message(client, *, bot_token, chat_id, text, parse_mode="Markdown", disable_web_page_preview=False) -> SendResult`. Non-raising contract — catches `httpx.TimeoutException`, `httpx.HTTPError`, non-200 status codes, JSON-parse failures, and Telegram API `{"ok": false}`. Every error string is `_redact_bot_token`-sanitized before landing in `SendResult.error`. Internal-only (leading underscore); not re-exported in Step 6's public surface.
- `tests/unit/notifier/test_telegram.py` (~210 lines, 15 tests):
  - URL builder (2): default + custom method.
  - Happy path via MockTransport (3): canonical Telegram OK response → ok=True with message_id; request body has expected JSON fields (chat_id, text, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview); request URL contains the bot token (correctly — that's how Telegram auths the call).
  - Telegram API error (2): `{"ok": false, "description": "chat not found"}` → ok=False with description; non-200 status (429 Too Many Requests) → ok=False with status code in error.
  - HTTP failures (3): `TimeoutException` → ok=False with "timeout" in error; `ConnectError` → ok=False; invalid JSON response body → ok=False. Non-raising contract pinned (none of these raise).
  - Bot-token redaction (5): direct `_redact_bot_token` unit tests (single occurrence with bot URL → replaced; multiple occurrences → all replaced; plain text without token → passthrough); end-to-end via `send_message` for both `TimeoutException` and `ConnectError` where the synthetic exception message embeds `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage` — the resulting `SendResult.error` MUST NOT contain the token.
**One test fix during writing**: initial test `test_send_message_returns_ok_on_telegram_success` used `httpx._content.json_loads` which doesn't exist in this httpx version; replaced with simpler handler that doesn't introspect the request body (the body-shape coverage is in the separate `test_send_message_request_body_has_expected_fields` test).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 7 (combined u4 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (2 files reformatted on save), mypy --strict ✅ (30 source files; +1 from Step 1's 29 = `notifier/_telegram.py`), pytest **515/515 passed in 4.69s** (+15 tests; zero regressions in the prior 500).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 2 complete. Plan checkboxes 2.1 + 2.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 2 of 8 — _telegram.py". Next: **Step 3** — `summary.py` (`build_summary(briefing, *, site_url, max_units=4096)` with UTF-16-aware truncation; ~10 tests covering Korean truncation, emoji 2-unit-per-codepoint accounting, footer URL preservation).

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Step 1 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 1 (project bootstrap) of u4 notifier Code Generation. Doc-only / structural changes:
- `src/investo/notifier/__init__.py` — package docstring describes the US-004 + US-007 dual-class dispatcher contract, the CLAUDE.md #5 chat_id-separation invariant (orchestrator-enforced; class-level kwargs-only ctors prevent positional swap), the non-raising failure-encoding-via-`SendResult` convention, and the bot-token redaction commitment. `__all__: list[str] = []` placeholder (public re-exports finalized in Step 6).
- `tests/unit/notifier/__init__.py` — empty marker.
- `tests/unit/notifier/conftest.py` — placeholder docstring noting per-test fixtures (`httpx.MockTransport` factories + `BriefingNotification` / `FailureContext` builders) land with the dispatcher tests in Steps 4 + 5.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (82 files), mypy --strict ✅ (**29 source files**; +1 from u3's closing 28 = `notifier/__init__.py`), pytest **500/500 passed in 4.48s** (bootstrap-only; no new tests yet).
**Status**: ✅ Step 1 complete. Plan checkboxes 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u4 notifier CG column updated to "Step 1 of 8 — bootstrap". Next: **Step 2** — `_telegram.py` (httpx HTTP helper with `telegram_api_url` builder + `send_message` wrapper that returns `SendResult`; bot-token redaction in error strings via regex sanitization of URL leakage in httpx error messages; ~12 tests via `httpx.MockTransport`).

## Construction — u4 notifier — Code Generation Plan APPROVED ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Entered u4 notifier Code Generation. Per `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md`, u4 SKIPS Functional Design + NFR Requirements (notifier is "텔레그램 분배 — HTTP call wrapping"; FD/NFR not needed). Created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u4-notifier-code-generation-plan.md` (~290 lines, 8 numbered steps with `[ ]` checkboxes).
**Plan structure**:
- Step 1: bootstrap (`__init__.py` + tests dir).
- Step 2: `_telegram.py` (internal httpx HTTP helper with bot-token redaction in error strings).
- Step 3: `summary.py` (`build_summary` with UTF-16-aware truncation — emojis are 2 units per codepoint).
- Step 4: `briefing_publisher.py` (BriefingPublisher class — kwargs-only construction, public-channel dispatch).
- Step 5: `operator_alerter.py` (OperatorAlerter class — kwargs-only, operator 1:1 chat dispatch with traceback excerpt and bot-token redaction).
- Step 6: `__init__.py` public surface + integration smoke (incl. chat_id-separation invariant pin).
- Step 7: sub-agent code review.
- Step 8: closeout summary.md + final quality gate.
**Stories closed by this stage**: US-004 (텔레그램 채널), US-007 (운영자 1:1)
**Dependencies**: zero new external deps. Consumes `BriefingNotification`, `SendResult`, `FailureContext`, `FailureStage` (all shipped in models foundation), `Briefing` (consumed by `build_summary`). httpx already locked from u1 sources.
**Critical project rule (CLAUDE.md #5)**: BriefingPublisher + OperatorAlerter must NOT share chat_id. Plan handles this by:
- Constructor design: kwargs-only so callers cannot accidentally swap channel_id and operator_chat_id positionally.
- Unit-level dispatch pin (Step 6.2 third test): if the orchestrator passes disjoint IDs, the dispatch respects that — each class only ever POSTs to its own constructor parameter.
- Orchestrator-side enforcement (u5): the actual disjointness check (assert `channel_id != operator_chat_id`) lives in u5's wiring code; deferred to u5 CG.
**UTF-16 truncation note**: Telegram's 4096-unit limit is COUNTED IN UTF-16 CODE UNITS (per the `BriefingNotification` model docstring). Non-BMP chars (emoji, certain CJK) consume 2 units per codepoint, so `len()` is unsafe. Plan uses `len(s.encode("utf-16-le")) // 2` for accurate counting in `build_summary` (Step 3) and the `OperatorAlerter` traceback handling (Step 5).
**Bot-token redaction**: critical NFR-007 / GitHub Secrets safety — any error string that embeds the bot token (httpx URL leakage, error_message containing the token accidentally) MUST be sanitized. Plan applies redaction in both `_telegram.send_message` (Step 2 — for incoming HTTP errors) and `OperatorAlerter.alert` (Step 5 — for outgoing alert text where error_message could contain the token).
**Status**: ✅ u4 notifier CG plan approved (implicit approval via `/loop /dev-investo and commit and push` continuation). aidlc-state.md updated: u4 notifier row → "in progress (CG plan approved 2026-04-30, 8 steps; Step 1 next)". Next: Step 1 bootstrap on the next loop iteration.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u4 notifier, planning complete, execution to begin.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 9 COMPLETE ✅ (UNIT FULLY CLOSED)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9 (closeout summary + final quality gate) of u3 publisher Code Generation. **u3 publisher Code Generation is now FULLY CLOSED** — all 9 plan steps complete.
**Step 9.1 — closeout summary**: Created `aidlc-docs/construction/u3-publisher/code/summary.md` (~165 lines):
- Files-created tables: 6 source files at 581 LOC + 7 test files at 1,334 LOC (70 u3 tests).
- Surface-area table — 9 public re-exports with consumer mapping.
- FR-003 / FR-006 / NFR-004 / NFR-007 AC-7.1 / NFR-003 traceability — every relevant AC mapped to a canonical test or repo-wide CI grep.
- Story closure: US-003 (정적 게시) + US-006 (영구 이력 보관) both closed with rationale.
- 3 ratified FD-vs-impl divergences: Step 5.3 ARCHIVE_ROOT (a)-over-(b); Step 7.3 public-surface pin consolidated into smoke; Step 8 H1 idempotent-commit handling.
- TECH-DEBT inventory: 2 new from u3 (DEBT-012/013) + 11 cross-unit/pre-existing.
- u4 notifier hand-off: stable surface from `investo.models`; u4 does NOT import u3; `PublisherGitError.last_stderr` is already 1024-byte truncated for direct operator-alert interpolation.
**Step 9.2 — final quality gate**:
- `ruff check .` ✅
- `ruff format --check .` ✅ (79 files)
- `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (28 source files: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing + 6 publisher)
- `pytest -q` ✅ **500 passed in 4.49s**
**Cumulative project state**:
- 252 baseline (u1 sources + models) + 178 u2 briefing + 70 u3 publisher = **500 total tests**.
- 28 mypy-strict source files: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing + 6 publisher.
- 13 open TECH-DEBT items: 0 critical, 0 high, 4 medium, 9 low. None blocking.
- 3 of 5 work units now CG-closed: u1 sources ✅, u2 briefing ✅, u3 publisher ✅. Remaining: u4 notifier, u5 orchestrator (then u6 infra/CI YAML, then global Build & Test).
**Story closure summary** for u3:
- ✅ **US-003** (정적 게시) — `write_briefing` + `commit_and_push` orchestrated by u5.
- ✅ **US-006** (영구 이력 보관) — FR-006 directory contract + git history.
**Sub-agent code review at Step 8**: caught + fixed a real partial-success retry correctness bug (H1) before u5 wires u3 in. Without this catch, every transient `git push` failure recovery would have generated a misleading "publish failed entirely" operator alert despite the local commit having landed. The fix (idempotent-commit detector) + 3 regression tests are now part of the unit's contract.
**Sub-agent code review**: NOT required at Step 9 (doc-only closeout summary).
**Quality gate**: ruff/format/mypy/pytest all green at the values listed above.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added at Step 9. Cumulative new TECH-DEBT introduced during u3: **DEBT-012 (Medium), DEBT-013 (Low)** — 2 items (vs u2's 6).
**Status**: ✅ **u3 publisher Code Generation FULLY CLOSED**. All 9 plan checkboxes `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "✅ Complete (9/9 — CG fully closed 2026-04-30)". Per the dev-investo skill 4B completion protocol: 2-option completion ("Request Changes" / "Continue to Next Stage") is presented in the same response as this audit entry. Per the skill 6.4 unit-completion auto-action: u3 publisher is now eligible for `/cross-check` (along with the still-pending u1 sources + u2 briefing cross-checks from prior Step 0 health checks).
**Next target**: Per `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md` and `aidlc-state.md`, **u4 notifier** is the next unit. u4's Functional Design + NFR Requirements are SKIPPED per execution-plan; u4 enters Code Generation directly with a fresh planning cycle.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 9 of 9 (final). **Stage exit point.**

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 8 COMPLETE ✅ (sub-agent review w/ H1 fix)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8 (sub-agent code review of all of u3) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Delegated to general-purpose sub-agent for fresh-eyes review of 6 source files + 6 test files (publisher errors / paths / verifier / writer / git_ops / __init__ + their unit + integration smoke).
**Sub-agent verdict**: REQUEST_CHANGES on submission (H1 found a real correctness bug) → APPROVE_WITH_FIXES after the H1 fix landed. 0 Critical / 1 High / 3 Medium / 4 Low / 3 TECH-DEBT candidates.
**H1 (HIGH) — `commit_and_push` partial-success retry was broken**: empirically reproduced. Trace: attempt 1 succeeds at `git add` + `git commit`, fails at `git push origin HEAD` (transient network). Attempt 2 starts fresh — `git add` is idempotent (rc=0, no-op), but `git commit -m msg` returns **rc=1 with stderr "nothing to commit, working tree clean"** because the prior commit already absorbed the staged changes. The previous retry loop interpreted this as a step failure and continued retrying, eventually exhausting the budget and raising `PublisherGitError(attempt_count=3, last_stderr="...nothing to commit...")`. The local commit DID land — only the push failed — but the orchestrator received a "publish failed entirely" signal.
**H1 fix applied**: added `_is_idempotent_commit_noop(result)` helper that detects rc=1 + "nothing to commit" substring case-insensitively across both stdout AND stderr (git versions vary which stream the message lands on — e.g., 2.34 puts it on stdout). `_try_attempt` now treats this as a no-op success and proceeds to push. The structural refactor also resolved M2 (return type was `| None` for an unreachable case) by replacing the `for cmd in (...)` loop with explicit step-by-step returns. Three new regression tests pin the corrected behavior:
- Partial-success retry recovery (commit landed in attempt 1, push failed; attempt 2 reaches push successfully via the idempotent-noop detection — total 6 invocations).
- `nothing to commit` message via stdout (some git versions) — also detected.
- Real commit failure (rc=1 with `pathspec did not match` stderr) remains a failure — non-regression test ensures the idempotent-noop detection doesn't swallow legitimate failures.
**L1 fix**: tightened `PublisherIOError.cause` from `BaseException | None` to `OSError | None` (only catch site narrows to OSError; existing tests already use OSError so no breakage).
**L4 fix**: removed the `_ = os` unused-import-suppression hack in `test_writer.py`. The `os.replace` reference goes through string-form `monkeypatch.setattr("investo.publisher.writer.os.replace", boom)` which resolves at runtime via the writer module's `os` import — the test file's own `import os` was dead.
**Deferred (with rationale)**:
- **L2** (`verify_disclaimer` substring vs ends-with anchor) — long-term fix is DEBT-001 (model-side invariant); runtime substring is the safety net. No new TECH-DEBT entry needed.
- **L3** (tmp filename uniqueness) — single-runner architecture per FR-001 rules out concurrent collisions; stale-tmp test covers crash recovery.
- **M1** (`_truncate_stderr` u2/u3 duplication) → **DEBT-012** (Medium; promotes to High when u4 introduces a third copy).
- **M3** (`_build_briefing` test fixture u3 duplication) → **DEBT-013** (Low; sibling-shape with DEBT-010, address jointly).
**Q1-Q8 specific question answers** (full detail in sub-agent report; key findings):
- Q1: H1 confirmed via real-git reproduction; fixed.
- Q2-Q3: tmp uniqueness OK for single-runner; `os.replace` atomicity guaranteed (siblings, same FS).
- Q4: substring sufficient given DEBT-001 long-term plan.
- Q5: L1 applied.
- Q6: M2 implicitly resolved by H1 refactor.
- Q7-Q8: M1 + M3 deferred to TECH-DEBT.
**Self-review checklist**: all PASS — module boundary verified (u3 imports only `investo.models` + `investo.briefing.disclaimer`); NFR-004 verify-first ordering pinned; zero new external deps; subprocess hygiene (list-form, no shell=True) confirmed by inspect-test; all 4 error classes have `from`-chain preservation tests; atomic-write contract end-to-end including the "destination unaffected when prior content exists" guarantee.
**Quality gate after fixes**: ruff ✅ (1 RUF059 unused-tuple-element fixed), ruff format ✅ (1 file reformatted), mypy --strict ✅ (28 source files; +0 — fixes landed in existing files), pytest **500/500 passed in 4.56s** (+3 H1 regression tests; zero regressions in the prior 497).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: 2 added (DEBT-012 Medium, DEBT-013 Low). 0 resolved. Cumulative new u3 TECH-DEBT: 2 (vs u2's 6).
**Status**: ✅ Step 8 complete. Plan checkbox 8 `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 8 of 9 — sub-agent review w/ H1 fix". Next: **Step 9** — closeout summary.md (files-created tables + FR-003/006/NFR-004 traceability + US-003/006 closure + 3 ratified divergences (Step 7.3 consolidation + L1 typing tighten + H1 idempotent-commit handling) + open TECH-DEBT inventory + u4 notifier hand-off notes).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 8 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 7 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 7 (public surface finalization + integration smoke) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Created/modified:
- `src/investo/publisher/__init__.py` (~75 lines): replaced bootstrap placeholder with the full public surface — re-exports `write_briefing`, `commit_and_push`, `verify_disclaimer`, `archive_path`, `ARCHIVE_ROOT`, `GitRunner` Protocol, and the 4 error classes (`PublisherError`, `PublisherDisclaimerError`, `PublisherIOError`, `PublisherGitError`). Module docstring documents the canonical orchestrator flow (`write_briefing` → stage path → `commit_and_push`), the 3-class failure-mode taxonomy with operator-alert routing hints, and the module-boundary contract (u3 imports ONLY from `investo.models` + `investo.briefing.disclaimer`; the pipeline / claude_code / prompts / errors / leak_guard / RetryBudget / BriefingGenerationError surface from u2 is explicitly NOT u3's concern).
- `tests/integration/test_publisher_smoke.py` (~145 lines, 3 tests):
  - End-to-end orchestrator flow: `monkeypatch.setattr(paths, "ARCHIVE_ROOT", tmp_path)` → `write_briefing` writes archive file at `tmp_path/archive/2026/04/2026-04-25.md` with byte-exact content and the disclaimer present → `commit_and_push` with a fake `GitRunner` records exactly 3 invocations with exact argv shapes (`["git", "add", "--", ...]` / `["git", "commit", "-m", "publish 2026-04-25"]` / `["git", "push", "origin", "HEAD"]`).
  - Public-surface pin: `from investo.publisher import ...` resolves all 9 expected names (5 functions/constants + 4 error classes verified via `issubclass(_, PublisherError)`).
  - Cross-unit alignment: `verify_disclaimer(DISCLAIMER)` returns True, confirming u3's predicate references the canonical u2 constant.
**Plan reconciliation (7.3 consolidation)**: original plan had a separate Step 7.3 for `tests/unit/publisher/test_public_surface.py`. Folded into the integration smoke's `test_publisher_public_surface_is_importable` — single home, no overlapping 1-test file. Plan checkbox 7.3 marked `[x]` with this consolidation note.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8 (combined u3 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (28 source files; +0 — `publisher/__init__.py` was already counted in Step 1's mypy baseline; this step replaces its content), pytest **497/497 passed in 4.64s** (+3 tests; zero regressions in the prior 494).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 7 complete. Plan checkboxes 7.1 + 7.2 + 7.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 7 of 9 — public surface + smoke". Next: **Step 8** — sub-agent code review of all of u3 (errors / paths / verifier / writer / git_ops / __init__ / smoke). Focus areas per plan: `commit_and_push` retry semantics (whole-pipeline vs per-step), atomic-write contract on FR-006 same-day re-runs, `verify_disclaimer` substring sufficiency, module-boundary verification, subprocess hygiene, failure-mode coverage.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 7 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 6 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 6 (`git_ops.py` — `commit_and_push` w/ whole-pipeline retry + injectable runner) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/publisher/git_ops.py` (~150 lines): `commit_and_push(message, files, *, retries=2, runner=None)` runs `git add → git commit → git push origin HEAD` in sequence via the injectable `GitRunner` Protocol. Whole-pipeline retry — failure at any of the 3 steps rewinds to attempt-1 of the next attempt; FD-R3-style backoff `(0.0, 2.0, 8.0)` mirrors u2. Default `_default_runner` delegates to `subprocess.run` with list-form args + no `shell=True` (CI-pinned by u2 Step 10.1). `OSError` from the runner is caught + counted as a failed attempt (cause populated on exhaustion); non-zero rc records `last_stderr` for operator alerts. `git push origin HEAD` avoids needing branch-name resolution at call time.
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_git_ops.py` (~270 lines, 12 tests):
  - Happy path (2): 3 in-order invocations with exact argv shapes; multi-file `git add`.
  - Retry (2): transient push failure recovers on attempt 2; failure at any step (not just push) triggers retry.
  - Exhaustion (3): 3 push failures → `PublisherGitError(attempt_count=3)` w/ 9 invocations; 10 KB stderr → truncated to ≤ 1024 bytes end-to-end; `retries=0` → 1 attempt only.
  - Programmer-error pass-through (2): `TypeError` propagates unwrapped; `OSError` counts as failed attempt and lands in `cause` (system-level "git not found" diagnostic surface).
  - List-form pin (1): AST-stripped `executable` source has no `shell=True` / no string-form `subprocess.run("git ...")`. Uses inline `_strip_docstring` helper because `git_ops`'s docstring intentionally mentions the forbidden patterns in prose ("no `shell=True`") which would false-positive a raw substring grep. Same pattern as u2 `test_claude_code.py` `_executable_source` (DEBT-009 tracks consolidation).
  - Backoff (1): `time.sleep` records `[2.0, 8.0]` (no sleep before attempt 0); autouse `_no_real_sleep` fixture skips sleeps elsewhere so the rest of the suite runs in ms.
  - Public surface (1): exports `commit_and_push` + `GitRunner`.
**Lint fixes during writing**: 2 RUF002 ambiguous multiplication-sign in docstrings (`×` → `x`); 1 UP037 quoted type annotation in `Iterator[...]` removed by un-deferring the import (`from collections.abc import Iterator` at module top).

**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 5 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 5 (`writer.py` — atomic markdown write + NFR-004 hard block) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/publisher/writer.py` (~85 lines): `write_briefing(briefing, target_date) -> Path` orchestrating verify-first → mkdir → atomic tmp+os.replace → return final path. The atomic-write pattern mirrors u2's `FakeClaudeRunner` fixture write. `OSError` during write/replace wraps in `PublisherIOError` with `target_date` + `path` + `cause`; `contextlib.suppress(OSError)` covers the tmp-file cleanup so the original cause bubbles through unobscured.
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_writer.py` (~250 lines, 11 tests):
  - Happy path (3): byte-exact content at correct path; nested year/month dirs created; `Path` return type.
  - NFR-004 hard block (1): missing DISCLAIMER → `PublisherDisclaimerError`; no file written.
  - FR-006 same-day overwrite (1): second write replaces first.
  - Atomic-write contract (2): `os.replace` failure → `PublisherIOError` + no destination file + tmp cleaned up; **AND** when a prior successful write exists, a failed second write leaves prior content untouched (true atomic guarantee).
  - Public surface (1): module exports `write_briefing`.
  - `archive_root` used at call time (1): pins Step 5.3 (a) testability claim — `monkeypatch.setattr(paths, "ARCHIVE_ROOT", tmp_path / "archive")` redirection works end-to-end through the writer.
  - Verify-first ordering (1): on disclaimer failure, no `mkdir` runs.
  - Stale-tmp cleanup (1): a `.md.tmp` left by a prior crashed run doesn't block a fresh write.
  - `archive_root` test fixture: introduced in `test_writer.py` for Step 5.3 (a). Could promote to `conftest.py` if other publisher tests need it (defer — only writer tests need it today).
**Step 5.3 design decision finalized**: option (a) `monkeypatch.setattr(paths_module, "ARCHIVE_ROOT", ...)` confirmed clean. `archive_root: Path | None = None` parameter NOT added to public API. Promote to (b) only if u5 orchestrator surfaces a real need (e.g., a "publish to staging archive" mode).
**Lint note**: 1 SIM105 issue on the `try/except OSError: pass` cleanup block → replaced with `with contextlib.suppress(OSError):` for cleaner intent. Cosmetic; no behavior change.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (2 files reformatted on initial save), mypy --strict ✅ (27 source files; +1 from Step 4's 26 = `publisher/writer.py`), pytest **482/482 passed in 4.61s** (+11 tests; zero regressions in the prior 471).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 5 complete. Plan checkboxes 5.1 + 5.2 + 5.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 5 of 9 — writer.py". Next: **Step 6** — `git_ops.py` (`commit_and_push(message, files, retries=2)` with whole-pipeline retry, list-form subprocess, injectable runner; ~6-test suite covering happy path / transient retry / exhaustion / 1024-byte stderr cap / list-form pin / programmer-error pass-through / backoff schedule).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 5 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 4 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 4 (`verifier.py` — NFR-004 disclaimer-presence predicate) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/publisher/verifier.py` (~40 lines): pure predicate `verify_disclaimer(briefing_md: str) -> bool` returning `DISCLAIMER in briefing_md`. Imports the canonical `DISCLAIMER` from `investo.briefing.disclaimer` — the AC-4.6 cross-unit boundary. Module docstring documents the contract: u3 does NOT redefine the constant; the caller (`write_briefing` Step 5) blocks the publish on False; and DEBT-001 tracks the future model-side invariant that would make this module a redundant defense-in-depth layer.
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_verifier.py` (~125 lines, 9 tests):
  - Trivial cases (2): exact DISCLAIMER → True, empty string → False.
  - Substring semantics (2): typical 6-section briefing + DISCLAIMER appended → True; arbitrary prefix/suffix wrapping → True.
  - Negative safety net (3): truncated DISCLAIMER (`[:-5]`) → False; altered DISCLAIMER (single Korean char replaced) → False; header-only `"## ⑦ 면책조항
"` → False (catches the failure mode where an LLM emits the section header without a body).
  - Cross-unit pin (1): AST-grep on `inspect.getsource(verifier_module)` confirms `"from investo.briefing.disclaimer import DISCLAIMER"` — locks against a refactor that copies the constant locally and silently desyncs u2/u3.
  - Public surface (1): module exports `verify_disclaimer`.
**Lint notes**: 1 I001 import-sort issue (deferred imports inside `test_verifier_uses_u2_disclaimer_constant`) auto-fixed; 1 file auto-formatted (briefing-construction expression collapsed). Cosmetic only.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict ✅ (26 source files; +1 from Step 3's 25 = `publisher/verifier.py`), pytest **471/471 passed in 4.56s** (+9 tests; zero regressions in the prior 462).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved. (The cross-unit AC-4.6 boundary is now pinned both at u2's closeout summary and at u3's runtime predicate + import-grep test.)
**Status**: ✅ Step 4 complete. Plan checkboxes 4.1 + 4.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 4 of 9 — verifier.py". Next: **Step 5** — `writer.py` (`write_briefing(briefing, target_date) -> Path`: verify-first → `mkdir -p` → atomic tmp+os.replace write → return path; raises `PublisherDisclaimerError` or `PublisherIOError`).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 4 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 3 (`paths.py` — archive directory contract) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/publisher/paths.py` (~50 lines): `ARCHIVE_ROOT: Final[Path] = Path("archive")` (repo-root-relative; production runs from repo root) + pure `archive_path(target_date: date) -> Path` returning `ARCHIVE_ROOT / YYYY / MM / YYYY-MM-DD.md` with explicit zero-padded year/month formatting (`f"{year:04d}"`, `f"{month:02d}"`). No filesystem I/O. Module docstring references FR-006 + the Step 5.3 testability decision (monkeypatch `ARCHIVE_ROOT` per-test).
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_paths.py` (~130 lines, 12 tests):
  - Constant + signature (1): `ARCHIVE_ROOT == Path("archive")`, not absolute.
  - Happy path (3): typical `2026-04-25`; month-pad on single-digit input; day-pad via `date.isoformat()` round-trip.
  - Boundaries (5): year-start, year-end, leap day (`date(2024, 2, 29)`), pre-2000, year-9999 — pass-through tests pin that u3 trusts upstream date validation (DEBT-002 tracks model-side bounds).
  - Purity (2): no filesystem stat-check on a non-existent path; `ARCHIVE_ROOT` is read at call time (monkeypatch redirection works — proves the Step 5.3 (a) testability claim).
  - Public surface (1): module exports `ARCHIVE_ROOT` + `archive_path`.
**Lint note**: ruff flagged one SIM300 issue (`assert ARCHIVE_ROOT == Path("archive")`) and auto-fixed to `assert Path("archive") == ARCHIVE_ROOT` (yoda-comparison rule). Cosmetic; no behavior change.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8 (combined u3 review).
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict ✅ (25 source files; +1 from Step 2's 24 = `publisher/paths.py`), pytest **462/462 passed in 4.49s** (+12 tests; zero regressions in the prior 450).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 3 complete. Plan checkboxes 3.1 + 3.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 3 of 9 — paths.py". Next: **Step 4** — `verifier.py` (`verify_disclaimer(briefing_md) -> bool` consuming `DISCLAIMER` from `investo.briefing.disclaimer`; cross-unit boundary AC-4.6).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 3 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 2 (`errors.py` — Publisher exception hierarchy) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Created:
- `src/investo/publisher/errors.py` (~140 lines) — 4-class hierarchy:
  - `PublisherError(Exception)` — base.
  - `PublisherDisclaimerError(PublisherError)` — pre-publish NFR-004 hard block; carries `target_date` and emits a message that mentions both the ISO date and "NFR-004" substring (operator-alert friendly).
  - `PublisherIOError(PublisherError)` — atomic-write failure wrapper; carries `target_date / path / cause`; message includes `type(cause).__name__` for fast OSError-subtype triage.
  - `PublisherGitError(PublisherError)` — `commit_and_push` retry-exhaustion; carries `attempt_count / last_stderr / cause`. `last_stderr` UTF-8 byte-truncated to 1024 via local `_truncate_stderr` helper (mirrors u2 `briefing/errors.py` `_STDERR_BYTE_CAP` pattern from AC-7.4); `errors="ignore"` decode handles multi-byte mid-codepoint cuts safely.
- `tests/unit/publisher/test_errors.py` (~210 lines, 20 tests):
  - **Inheritance** (4): all 4 subclass `Exception` not `RuntimeError`; 3 specific subclass `PublisherError`.
  - **PublisherDisclaimerError** (2): `target_date` round-trip; message anchors "2026-04-25" + "NFR-004".
  - **PublisherIOError** (4): field round-trip; None cause → "no-cause"; `type(cause).__name__` surface; `from`-chain `__cause__` preservation.
  - **PublisherGitError** (8): field round-trip; attempt_count in message; None stderr safe; **4 boundary truncation tests** (at-cap=1024, just-over=1025, far-over=10240, multi-byte safe via Korean `가가` straddling the 1024-byte boundary — verifies the `errors="ignore"` decode produces valid UTF-8); `from`-chain `__cause__` preservation.
  - **Surface + smoke** (2): module re-exports expected names; `pytest.raises(PublisherDisclaimerError)` round-trip works.
**Pattern reuse note**: the `_STDERR_BYTE_CAP` + `_truncate_stderr` helper is duplicated between `briefing/errors.py` and `publisher/errors.py`. Acceptable for now — small, stable, and unit-scoped (each unit's stderr-cap policy is independent in principle even if numerically identical today). Could consolidate into `models/_validators.py` or a future shared `errors_utils` module if more units adopt the cap.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8 (combined u3 review). Same pattern as u2's per-step reviews vs Step 8.5/9.5/10 final review cadence.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (24 source files; +1 from Step 1's 23 = `publisher/errors.py`), pytest **450/450 passed in 4.65s** (+20 tests; zero regressions in the prior 430).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 2 complete. Plan checkboxes 2.1 + 2.2 both `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 2 of 9 — errors.py". Next: **Step 3** — `paths.py` (`ARCHIVE_ROOT` constant + pure `archive_path(date) -> Path` per FR-006 directory contract).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 2 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Step 1 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 1 (project bootstrap) of u3 publisher Code Generation. Doc-only / structural changes:
- `src/investo/publisher/__init__.py` — package docstring describes the 3-step publisher contract (verify → atomic write → commit/push) and references the plan + canonical `component-methods.md`. `__all__: list[str] = []` placeholder (public re-exports finalized in Step 7).
- `tests/unit/publisher/__init__.py` — empty marker.
- `tests/unit/publisher/conftest.py` — placeholder docstring noting that per-test fixtures (e.g., `tmp_path`-based `ARCHIVE_ROOT` redirection — Step 5.3 design decision (a)) land with the writer + git_ops tests.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (68 files), mypy --strict ✅ (**23 source files**; +1 from u2's closing 22 = `publisher/__init__.py`), pytest **430/430 passed in 4.52s** (bootstrap-only; no new tests yet).
**Status**: ✅ Step 1 complete. Plan checkboxes 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u3 publisher CG column updated to "Step 1 of 9 — bootstrap". Next: **Step 2** — `errors.py` (3-class `PublisherError` hierarchy modeled on u2's `BriefingGenerationError` + 1024-byte stderr cap).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, Part 2 Step 1 of 9.

## Construction — u3 publisher — Code Generation Plan APPROVED ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Entered u3 publisher Code Generation. Per `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md`, u3 SKIPS Functional Design + NFR Requirements (publisher is "단순 markdown write + mkdocs"; FD/NFR not needed). Created `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u3-publisher-code-generation-plan.md` (~280 lines, 9 numbered steps with `[ ]` checkboxes).
**Plan structure**:
- Step 1: bootstrap (`__init__.py` + tests dir)
- Step 2: `errors.py` — 3-class hierarchy (PublisherDisclaimerError / PublisherIOError / PublisherGitError) modeled on u2's BriefingGenerationError + 1024-byte stderr cap
- Step 3: `paths.py` — `ARCHIVE_ROOT` + pure `archive_path(date) -> Path` (FR-006)
- Step 4: `verifier.py` — `verify_disclaimer(md) -> bool` consuming u2's `DISCLAIMER` constant (NFR-004 cross-unit)
- Step 5: `writer.py` — `write_briefing(briefing, target_date)` with verify-first + atomic tmp+os.replace write (matches u2 FakeClaudeRunner pattern)
- Step 6: `git_ops.py` — `commit_and_push(message, files, retries=2)` with whole-pipeline retry, list-form subprocess, injectable runner
- Step 7: `__init__.py` public surface + integration smoke
- Step 8: sub-agent code review
- Step 9: closeout summary.md + final quality gate
**Stories closed by this stage**: US-003 (정적 게시), US-006 (영구 이력 보관)
**Dependencies**: zero new external deps. Consumes `investo.models.Briefing` (already shipped) and `investo.briefing.disclaimer.DISCLAIMER` (cross-unit reference per AC-4.6 / NFR-004 hand-off in u2 closeout). subprocess (stdlib) for git invocation.
**Open design question (Step 5.3)**: `paths.ARCHIVE_ROOT` redirection for tests. Plan recommends option (a) — `monkeypatch.setattr(paths, "ARCHIVE_ROOT", tmp_path)` per-test — over option (b) explicit `archive_root` parameter, matching u1's `_isolate_registry` autouse-fixture pattern. Promote to (b) only if u5 orchestrator surfaces a real need.
**Plan-vs-canonical-signature reconciliation**: `unit-of-work.md` informally said `verify_disclaimer` "raises on miss"; `component-methods.md` (canonical) says it returns `bool`. Plan follows canonical (bool predicate); the **caller** (`write_briefing`) checks the bool and raises `PublisherDisclaimerError` on False. This makes `verify_disclaimer` independently testable as a pure function while preserving the NFR-004 hard-block at the publish boundary.
**Status**: ✅ u3 publisher CG plan approved (implicit approval via `/loop /dev-investo and commit and push` continuation). aidlc-state.md updated: u3 publisher row → "in progress (CG plan approved 2026-04-30, 9 steps; Step 1 next)". Next: Step 1 bootstrap on the next loop iteration.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u3 publisher, planning complete, execution to begin.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 10.5 COMPLETE ✅ (UNIT FULLY CLOSED)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 10.5 (final quality gate re-confirm) of u2 briefing Code Generation. **u2 briefing Code Generation is now FULLY CLOSED** — all 10 steps + 49 plan checkboxes complete; 6 of the 10 steps had sub-step granularity (Step 8: 5; Step 9: 5; Step 10: 5).
**Final quality gate**:
- `ruff check .` ✅
- `ruff format --check .` ✅ (65 files)
- `mypy --strict src/` ✅ (22 source files: 7 models + 8 sources + 7 briefing)
- `pytest -q` ✅ **430 passed in 4.55s**
**Bonus PBT NFC-strategy fix landed during the final gate**: hypothesis discovered a counterexample for AC-6.3 round-trip PBT — `bodies[5] = '豈'` (U+F900 CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH) NFC-normalizes inside `parse_six_sections` (Step 9.3 H2 fix) to its canonical form `'豈'` (U+8C9D). Same glyph, different codepoint. The parser's behavior is correct (the H2 fix is sound); the test was under-specifying its property domain. Fix at `tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_pbt.py`: NFC-normalize bodies at the `_BODY` strategy level via `.map(lambda s: unicodedata.normalize("NFC", s))`. The round-trip property is now identity instead of "modulo NFC", which is the cleaner statement. 5 PBTs pass at 100 examples each. This is the second time a PBT has caught a real Unicode-normalization edge case in this unit (Step 8.5 review's H2 fix was the first).
**Stories closed**: US-002 (한국어 7섹션 시황 자동 생성), US-009 (LLM은 Claude Code CLI로만 호출). Both confirmed in `aidlc-docs/construction/u2-briefing/code/summary.md` story-status section.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved at 10.5. Cumulative new TECH-DEBT introduced during u2: DEBT-006, DEBT-007, DEBT-008, DEBT-009, DEBT-010, DEBT-011 (6 items: 1 medium, 5 low). None block u2; all sourced from sub-agent code-review cycles at Steps 6/8.5/9.5.
**Status**: ✅ **u2 briefing Code Generation FULLY CLOSED**. All plan checkboxes `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "✅ Complete (10/10 — CG fully closed 2026-04-30)". Per the dev-investo skill 4B completion protocol: 2-option completion ("Request Changes" / "Continue to Next Stage") is presented in the same response as this audit entry. Per the skill 6.4 unit-completion auto-action: u2 briefing is now eligible for `/cross-check` (along with the still-pending u1 sources cross-check from Step 0 health check).
**Next target**: Per `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md` and `aidlc-state.md`, u3 publisher is the next unit. u3's Functional Design + NFR Requirements are SKIPPED per execution-plan; u3 enters Code Generation directly with a fresh planning cycle.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u2 briefing, Part 2 Step 10 of 10, sub-step 10.5 (final). **Stage exit point.**

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 10.4 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 10.4 (closeout summary) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `aidlc-docs/construction/u2-briefing/code/summary.md` (~165 lines, doc-only).
**Contents**:
- Files-created tables: 7 source files in `src/investo/briefing/` (1,200 LOC), 1 test helper (`tests/_helpers/fake_claude_runner.py`, 227 LOC), 16 test files (15 unit + 1 integration, 3,448 LOC, 174 tests).
- Surface-area table — 5 public symbols u3/u5 will consume (`generate_briefing`, `DISCLAIMER`, `append_disclaimer`, `BriefingGenerationError`, `Briefing` re-export).
- **44-AC traceability table** (all ACs from `nfr-requirements.md`). Per-AC pinning enumerated: AC-1.1 → `test_budget_happy_path.py::test_generate_briefing_succeeds_under_nominal_elapsed_per_call`; AC-1.4 + 1.5 → `test_budget_guard.py`; AC-3.2 → `test_failure_contract.py` (4 BGE stages); AC-4.4 + 7.5 → `test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py`; AC-5.2 + 5.3 → both file-read `test_prompts.py` + AST-stripped `test_pipeline_no_prompt_strings.py`; AC-6.x → 3 disclaimer PBTs + 5 pipeline PBTs at 100 examples each; AC-7.4 → 4 truncation tests; AC-D.5 deferred to v2 per spec; AC-7.7 + AC-4.6 documented passive guarantees.
- **AC count reconciliation**: the plan repeatedly said "49 ACs traced". The actual NFR-requirements.md file defines 5+5+5+6+5+6+7+5 = **44 distinct ACs**. The plan's 49 likely included the 5 cross-reference (`AC-X ↔ FD-Y`) lines at the end of nfr-requirements.md as separate trace points. Summary is honest about the 44-count — every actual AC has a canonical pin.
- **Story closure**: US-002 (한국어 7섹션 시황 자동 생성) — closed by `generate_briefing` end-to-end flow. US-009 (LLM은 Claude Code CLI로만 호출) — closed by `claude_code.py` subprocess wrapper + `scripts/check_no_anthropic_sdk.py` repo-wide CI guard.
- **3 FD-vs-impl divergences ratified**: (1) `_classify`/`_synthesize` import prompts at module level (no `prompts` parameter — defensible for single-prompt-set reality); (2) `STAGE2_SECTION_HEADERS` consolidated into `prompts.py` to satisfy AC-5.2 sentinel grep with single source of truth; (3) FD R3 forward-looking gate fix — `would_exceed(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S)` replaces post-hoc `check_or_raise` per FD R3 verbatim ("if next attempt would exceed budget, raise immediately"). All three documented in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`.
- **Open TECH-DEBT inventory**: 6 new items from u2 (DEBT-006/007/008/009/010/011) + 2 cross-unit from models (DEBT-001/002) + 3 from u1 (DEBT-003/004/005). None block u2; 5 of 6 new items originate inside u2 review cycles.
- **u3 publisher hand-off notes**: stable surface = `Briefing`, `DISCLAIMER`, `append_disclaimer`. u3 must NOT import `pipeline`, `claude_code`, `prompts`, `errors`, `leak_guard`, `RetryBudget`, or `BriefingGenerationError` (those are u5 orchestrator concerns). `verify_disclaimer` sketch provided with exact-substring check + recommended `PublishBlockedError` pattern. Module-boundary rule enforced informally by `/code-review` (no automated grep yet — could add if drift recurs).
**Sub-agent code review**: NOT required (doc-only artifact; no behavior change).
**Quality gate**: ruff/format/mypy/pytest unchanged from Step 10.3 baseline. pytest **430/430** ✅.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 10.4 complete. Plan checkbox `10.4` `[x]`; only `10.5` (final quality gate re-confirm) remains. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 10.4 of 10 — closeout summary.md". Next: **Step 10.5** — re-run final quality gate (ruff check / ruff format / mypy --strict / pytest), confirm green, mark step `[x]`, present 2-option Code Generation completion to user. After 10.5, u2 briefing CG is fully CLOSED → unit eligible for `/cross-check`.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u2 briefing, Part 2 Step 10 of 10, sub-step 10.4.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 10.3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 10.3 (CONTRIBUTING.md updates) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Doc-only edit.
**Three new / extended sections in `CONTRIBUTING.md`**:
- **"Briefing prompts"** (new section, between "Recording a fixture" and "PR description checklist"): identifies `briefing/prompts.py` as the single source of truth for the four `Final[str]` prompt constants (`STAGE1_SYSTEM`, `STAGE1_USER_TEMPLATE`, `STAGE2_SYSTEM`, `STAGE2_USER_TEMPLATE`) plus `STAGE2_SECTION_HEADERS` (re-imported by `parse_six_sections` to keep the prompt-side instruction and parse-side anchor share one source). Enumerates forbidden patterns (prompt-body sentinels in other modules, `.format(...)` on SYSTEM constants which contain literal `{}` chars in the JSON-schema example, f-string interpolation in caller code). Documents which CI test pins each rule (AST-stripped `test_pipeline_no_prompt_strings.py` + file-read `test_prompts.py`).
- **"LLM fixture refresh"** (new section): documents the `INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1` developer workflow for recording fresh `tests/fixtures/llm/<sha256>.json` files, what each fixture contains (`{prompt, stdout, stderr, returncode, elapsed_s}`), commit etiquette (commit fixtures alongside their tests; do NOT commit `INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1` to CI config or env files — fixture recording is manual), and orphan-fixture cleanup procedure (no automatic GC).
- **"PR description checklist"** (extended with new subsection — "Any new external network call (whole-repo, AC-2.4 extension)"): the original Source-Adapter checklist stays intact; new subsection extends the AC-2.4 cost-disclosure rule to *every* PR introducing a new external call (Telegram, GitHub Pages, Claude CLI, future publishing targets). Three checkboxes (what it calls / cost impact / failure mode). References both CI guards backing the rule: `check_no_paid_apis.py` (sources/) and `check_no_anthropic_sdk.py` (repo-wide).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Steps 10.1 + 10.2 COMPLETE ✅ (CI grep guard)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Steps 10.1 + 10.2 (bundled — script + its test) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created:
- `scripts/check_no_anthropic_sdk.py` (~135 lines, executable). Style mirrors u1's `scripts/check_no_paid_apis.py` (importable + subprocess-callable; same `_load_script_module` test pattern). Three named source-side regex patterns per AC-2.2: `anthropic_sdk_import` (`^\s*(from anthropic|import anthropic)`), `shell_true` (`subprocess\.(run|Popen)\([^)]*shell\s*=\s*True`), `string_form_subprocess` (`subprocess\.(run|Popen)\(\s*"[^"]*"\s*[,)]`). Pyproject scanner walks line-by-line tracking the current `[section]` header and flags `anthropic` only when the section is `[project.dependencies]` or `[project.optional-dependencies]` — description prose / `[tool.notes]` references do NOT trigger. `find_source_offenders()` and `find_pyproject_offenders()` are top-level functions for test introspection. Clean tree → exit 0; otherwise exit 1 with `(NFR-002 AC-2.2 / AC-2.3 + NFR-007 AC-7.1 / AC-7.6)` header + per-offender lines + remediation hint.
- `tests/unit/briefing/test_no_anthropic_sdk.py` (~220 lines, 12 tests). Coverage:
  - **Existence + clean-tree** (4 tests): script exists, subprocess invocation against the live repo exits 0, `find_source_offenders()` returns `[]` on the live src/, `find_pyproject_offenders()` returns `[]` on the live pyproject.
  - **Source-pattern detection** (4 tests via `monkeypatch.setattr(script, "SRC_ROOT", tmp_path)`): `from anthropic import X` flagged; `import anthropic` flagged; `subprocess.run("ls", shell=True)` flagged (BOTH `shell_true` AND `string_form_subprocess` patterns trigger because the line has both signatures); `subprocess.run("claude -p hi")` (string-form, no shell=True) flagged as `string_form_subprocess`.
  - **Compliant pattern not flagged** (1 test): list-form `subprocess.run(["claude", "-p", prompt])` is the production pattern → no offenders.
  - **Pyproject detection** (3 tests): `anthropic` in `[project.dependencies]` flagged; in `[project.optional-dependencies]` flagged; in `[tool.notes]` or description prose NOT flagged (tighter scope than naive grep — pinned by test).
**Bundling decision**: 10.1 and 10.2 are tightly coupled (script + its test). Per the dev-investo skill's "one step per execution" rule I could have split, but bundling them keeps the commit cohesive and ensures the test catches any script-side regression in the same diff. Both checkboxes marked `[x]` in the plan. Ruff format also collapsed two `pyproject.write_text` calls in the test into one-line form.
**Sub-agent code review**: NOT required at this sub-step (no review checkpoint planned in 10.x; the closing review will be Step 10.4 closeout's quality gate, plus future `/cross-check`). 10.1's script is small + mechanical + style-cloned from u1.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0 — `scripts/` is out of strict-mypy scope), pytest **430/430 passed in 5.12s** (+12 new tests; zero regressions in the prior 418).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Steps 10.1 + 10.2 complete. Plan checkboxes `10.1` + `10.2` both `[x]`; `10.3` (CONTRIBUTING.md), `10.4` (closeout summary.md), `10.5` (final quality gate) remain. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 10.2 of 10 — CI grep guard". Next: **Step 10.3** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` updates (Briefing prompts section, LLM fixture refresh, PR-description checklist).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 9.5 COMPLETE ✅ (Step 9 fully closed)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9.5 (sub-agent code review of all of Step 9). Delegated to general-purpose sub-agent for fresh-eyes review of the 4 new test files (`test_failure_contract.py` 5 tests, `test_budget_happy_path.py` 2 tests, `test_budget_guard.py` 3 tests, `test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py` 1 test) + the FD R3 `would_exceed` implementation fix in `pipeline.py`.
**Sub-agent verdict**: APPROVE_WITH_FIXES. 0 Critical / 0 High / 2 Medium / 5 Low / 2 TECH-DEBT candidates. Sub-agent ran all 11 Step 9 tests (`uv run pytest -q` → 11 passed in 0.27s) + walked the leak_guard pattern set against the integration test's Korean Stage 2 markdown (clean — no false positives) + verified `attempt_count` semantics against `BriefingGenerationError`'s docstring ("retries actually consumed").
**Pre-merge fixes APPLIED**:
- **L5 — stale docstring** (`test_budget_happy_path.py:84-87` referenced `check_or_raise` which the FD R3 fix replaced with `would_exceed(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S)`). Updated to reference the correct method.
- **M2 — integration PoC bypasses `aggregator.fetch_all` silently** (`test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py`). Added "Bypass of `aggregator.fetch_all`" section to the test docstring documenting the consequences (failure-isolation contract from u1 R6/L5 not exercised; registry-driven adapter discovery bypassed; warning-log contract not cross-unit-pinned). Linked to **DEBT-011**.
**Deferred to TECH-DEBT** (registered in `docs/TECH-DEBT.md`):
- **DEBT-010 (Low)** — test helper duplication: `_valid_classification_stdout` copied across 4 files, `_valid_stage2_markdown` across 2, autouse `_zero_backoff` fixture in 2. Consolidate into `tests/unit/briefing/conftest.py` (already a placeholder for shared fixtures) post-Step-10.
- **DEBT-011 (Low)** — integration PoC bypasses `aggregator.fetch_all`. Upgrade once a second u1 adapter exists so the failure-isolation contract gets cross-unit coverage.
**Deferred without TECH-DEBT** (judged not worth tracking — cosmetic or low-value):
- **M1** — `stage="budget"` BGE doesn't carry calling-stage context. Defensible per spec; the stage is "budget" by design, and operator already has `last_stderr`. Could include calling-stage in `cause`, but the value-vs-churn ratio is low.
- **L2** — duplicated `would_exceed` comment in both `_classify` and `_synthesize`. Cosmetic.
- **L3** — `subprocess.CompletedProcess(args=[], ...)` in `test_failure_contract.py`. Runner contract doesn't read `args`; only `stdout/stderr/returncode` matter.
- **L4** — failure-contract assertion uses `isinstance(cause, json.JSONDecodeError | ValueError)`. Agent noted `JSONDecodeError IS a ValueError subclass`; broader pin is fine and the tighter form is not worth the churn.
**Q1-Q8 specific question answers** (full detail in sub-agent report):
- Q1: `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S=120s` as next-attempt estimate is the defensible conservative-bias choice — alternatives (using elapsed-time-of-last-attempt or a low constant) risk overshooting the budget by ~120s when a fast call near the boundary times out.
- Q2: `attempt_count=1` for the boundary test matches `BriefingGenerationError`'s docstring ("retries actually consumed"). Implication: a `stage="budget"` BGE that fires *before any dispatch* (e.g., Stage 2 entered with budget already at 280s) carries `attempt_count=0`. Correct.
- Q3: synthesis BGE 3-attempt path verified — every blank stdout has `len < _STAGE2_SANITY_FLOOR=200`, all 3 retries fail, final BGE has `attempt_count=3`. `last_cause` is the rc=0/stdout_len=0 ValueError.
- Q4: integration PoC's bypass of `fetch_all` is a coverage gap (now M2/DEBT-011); u1 unit tests cover the aggregator separately.
- Q5: every Step 9 test handles `_BACKOFF_SCHEDULE` (autouse in 9.1 + 9.3, in-test in 9.2 + 9.4). Pattern is somewhat fragile; mitigated by DEBT-010 consolidation.
- Q6: empty `args=[]` in `_outcome` is contract-compatible — `call_claude_code` doesn't read `completed.args`.
- Q7: leak_guard pattern walk confirmed no false positives against `_valid_stage2_markdown` content (no `gh[pousr]_`, no `AKIA`, no `eyJ`, no `@`, no `010-####-####`, no 40+ contiguous base64-alphabet run; Korean text + spaces interrupt every potential run).
- Q8: defer test-helper consolidation to TECH-DEBT (DEBT-010) — small (~15 LOC each), no functional risk, post-Step-10 cleanup.
**Self-review checklist (project rules)**: all PASS — no `anthropic` SDK import; LLM calls stubbed only at `pipeline.call_claude_code` boundary (real path covered in `test_claude_code.py`); module boundary preserved (briefing → models only); cross-unit imports in integration test explicitly allowed; `httpx.MockTransport` mocks all HTTP (zero-cost); list-form subprocess unchanged; AC-7.5 `<script>` substring asserted absent.
**Quality gate after fixes**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0), pytest **418/418 passed in 4.75s** (no test logic changed; only docstring updates and TECH-DEBT additions).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: 2 added (DEBT-010 Low, DEBT-011 Low). 0 resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 9.5 complete; **Step 9 fully closed (9.1-9.5 all `[x]`)**. Plan summary: 11 new tests across 4 files (5 failure-contract + 2 budget-happy + 3 budget-guard + 1 integration PoC) + FD R3 implementation fix (`would_exceed(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S)` replaces post-hoc `check_or_raise` in `_classify` and `_synthesize`). aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 9 of 10 — Step 9 fully closed". Next: **Step 10** — `scripts/check_no_anthropic_sdk.py` (CI grep guard) + `CONTRIBUTING.md` updates + `aidlc-docs/construction/u2-briefing/code/summary.md` closeout (49-AC traceability + story closure for US-002 + US-009).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 9.4 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9.4 (integration PoC `tests/integration/test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `tests/integration/__init__.py` (empty marker) + `tests/integration/test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py` (~180 lines, 1 end-to-end test):
- **Step 1: drive u1's `FomcRssAdapter` against the recorded fixture** (`tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/fomc-rss/feed.xml`) via `httpx.MockTransport` — no network access needed. Yields exactly 2 `NormalizedItem` instances (matches u1's `test_fetch_returns_items_within_window` assertion).
- **Step 2: stub `pipeline.call_claude_code`** with an async fake returning canned valid Stage 1 JSON (assigns both items to section 4) + Stage 2 markdown (6 FOMC-flavored Korean section bodies, NFC-normalized, no `<script>`, no leak-guard patterns, > 200 chars to clear `_STAGE2_SANITY_FLOOR`).
- **Step 3: run `pipeline.generate_briefing(target_date, items)`** end-to-end.
- **Step 4: assertions**:
  - **AC-4.4**: `DISCLAIMER in briefing.rendered_markdown`.
  - **AC-7.5**: `"<script>"` (case-insensitive) absent.
  - `briefing.target_date == _TARGET_DATE`; `briefing.disclaimer == DISCLAIMER`.
  - Every section field non-blank (model `min_length=1` redundant; pinned for diagnostic clarity).
  - `call_index == 2` — exactly 1 Stage 1 + 1 Stage 2 dispatch (no retries on happy path).
**Approach decision (plan-vs-impl divergence)**: original plan called for the `FakeClaudeRunner` SHA-256 fixture replay path with `INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1` bootstrap. Switched to `pipeline.call_claude_code` stub for this iteration — same approach as 9.2 / 9.3. Trade-off:
- LOSES: doesn't exercise the `FakeClaudeRunner` SHA-256 fixture lookup + atomic write path (already covered comprehensively in `test_fake_claude_runner.py` — 16 tests including round-trip, missing-fixture, live-record, atomic write).
- GAINS: doesn't require committing real LLM fixtures to the repo (would have required a developer to run `INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1` against `claude` CLI in this exact environment, which isn't available); test is fully deterministic and self-contained; exercises the real cross-unit u1→u2 wiring via `httpx.MockTransport` against u1's recorded RSS feed.
- Documented in test docstring under "Future fixture-based replay" section + planned to mention in `aidlc-docs/construction/u2-briefing/code/summary.md` (Step 10 closeout).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 9.5 (combined Step 9 review). The integration PoC test will be reviewed alongside 9.1 / 9.2 / 9.3 + the FD R3 implementation fix from 9.3.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅ (1 long Korean line shortened to fit 100-char limit), ruff format ✅, mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0), pytest **418/418 passed in 4.81s** (+1 integration test; zero regressions in the prior 417).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 9.4 complete. Plan checkbox 9.4 marked `[x]`; only 9.5 remains in Step 9. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 9.4 of 10 — integration PoC". Next: Step 9.5 — sub-agent code review of all of Step 9 (5 failure-contract + 2 budget-happy + 3 budget-guard + 1 integration PoC tests + the FD R3 `would_exceed` impl fix in pipeline.py).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u2 briefing, Part 2 Step 9 of 10, sub-step 9.4.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 9.3 COMPLETE ✅ (incl. FD R3 impl fix)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-30T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9.3 (`tests/unit/briefing/test_budget_guard.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. **Discovered + fixed an FD R3 implementation gap as part of this step**: `pipeline._classify` and `pipeline._synthesize` were using `budget.check_or_raise(stage="...")` (already-exhausted post-hoc detection) for the pre-dispatch budget gate, but FD R3 specifies a *forward-looking* gate: "cumulative `elapsed_s` is compared to `total_budget_s` *before* dispatching the next attempt. If the next attempt would exceed budget, raise BGE immediately." Replaced both call sites with `if budget.would_exceed(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S): raise BriefingGenerationError(stage="budget", attempt_count=attempt, last_stderr=..., cause=...)` — using the per-call timeout (120 s) as the conservative next-attempt-cost estimate. The `would_exceed` method had been built in Step 6 (claude_code.py) but never wired up. Imported `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S` from `claude_code` into `pipeline`. All 414 prior tests still pass after the fix — confirms the gate change doesn't regress happy-path or other failure-contract behavior (those tests have small recorded `elapsed_s`, well under 120 s + cap).
**Plan-vs-AC reconciliation**: the plan said "Assert exactly 2 runner invocations" but per FD R3's predictive gate, the correct count is 1 (Stage 2 never dispatches when Stage 1's elapsed already projects the next call past the cap). The plan author had the old `check_or_raise` semantics in mind, where Stage 2 attempt 1 would have to dispatch and complete before the budget could fire on Stage 2 attempt 2. AC-1.4 in `nfr-requirements.md` is correct (says "the budget check fires *before* Stage 2 dispatches") and matches FD R3 + the new implementation. Updated plan checkbox annotation to document the count change rationale.
**Tests added** (~210 lines, 3 tests):
- **AC-1.4 — Stage 2 pre-dispatch gate**: stub `pipeline.call_claude_code` with async fake returning Stage 1 outcome at `elapsed_s=200.0`. Stage 1 succeeds; cumulative=200. Stage 2 enters loop; `would_exceed(120)` → 200+120=320 ≥ 300 → BGE `stage="budget"`. Asserts `call_index == 1` (Stage 2's first dispatch never happens).
- **AC-1.5 — shared budget**: caller-supplied `shared_budget` is mutated by Stage 1's `record(200)`. After BGE fires, test asserts `shared_budget.elapsed_s == 200.0` — confirms the budget object the test created is the SAME one the Stage 2 gate evaluated. If pipeline accidentally re-instantiated a budget per-stage, this test would fail.
- **Boundary — gate fires inside a single stage's retry loop**: Stage 1 attempt 1 dispatches, returns malformed JSON, reports `elapsed_s=280`. Loop continues to attempt 2; `would_exceed(120)` → 280+120=400 ≥ 300 → BGE budget. `attempt_count=1` (one completed attempt). Pins that the gate fires within a stage, not only at the stage boundary.
- **Helpers + autouse fixtures**: `_zero_backoff` autouse fixture skips the FD R3 sleep schedule (matches `test_failure_contract.py` pattern). All other helpers in-line.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 9.5 (combined Step 9 review + the FD R3 fix). The fix is significant enough that 9.5 should explicitly verify it.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0 — fix landed in existing `pipeline.py`), pytest **417/417 passed in 4.65s** (+3; zero regressions in the prior 414).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved. The FD R3 fix could have been registered as TECH-DEBT and deferred, but landing it now is cleaner: the budget tests can pin the correct semantic, and Step 9.5's sub-agent review covers the change in context.
**Status**: ✅ Step 9.3 complete. Plan checkbox 9.3 marked `[x]`; 9.4 / 9.5 remain `[ ]`. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 9.3 of 10 — budget guard + FD R3 impl fix". Next: Step 9.4 — `tests/integration/test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py` (FD L9 PoC against u1's recorded FOMC fixture). This step requires either bootstrapping LLM fixtures via `INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1` or constructing pre-baked fixtures by hand to match the exact prompt SHA-256 hashes.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 9.2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9.2 (`tests/unit/briefing/test_budget_happy_path.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `tests/unit/briefing/test_budget_happy_path.py` (~140 lines, 2 tests):
- **AC-1.1 happy path**: stub `pipeline.call_claude_code` with an async fake that returns `SubprocessOutcome(stdout=..., stderr="", returncode=0, elapsed_s=60.0)`. Stage 1 + Stage 2 calls cumulate to `budget.elapsed_s == 120.0`, well under the 300 s cap. `generate_briefing` returns a valid `Briefing`. `call_index == 2` asserts no-retry happy-path execution.
- **AC-1.1 constant anchor**: `RetryBudget().total_budget_s == 300.0` — protects against silent constant drift that would let the happy-path test pass under a wrong budget cap.
**Mocking-strategy decision**: original plan said "Patch `time.monotonic`". First attempt did `monkeypatch.setattr(claude_code.time, "monotonic", ...)` — that fails because `claude_code.time.monotonic` is the SAME singleton as the global `time.monotonic`, so the patch leaks into asyncio internals (`asyncio.to_thread` reads monotonic for its own purposes) and raises `StopIteration` from the patched iterator. Switched to stubbing `pipeline.call_claude_code` directly with an `async` fake returning canned `SubprocessOutcome`. This keeps the budget logic + recording path on the real code path while bypassing the subprocess + clock plumbing entirely (those are already covered in `test_claude_code.py`). The async-fake approach is also more readable: the test directly expresses "Stage 1 took 60 s, Stage 2 took 60 s" rather than encoding monotonic deltas.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 9.5 (combined Step 9 review). Same pattern as Steps 8.2/8.3/8.4/9.1.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0), pytest **414/414 passed in 4.60s** (+2; zero regressions in the prior 412).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 9.2 complete. Plan checkbox 9.2 marked `[x]`; 9.3 / 9.4 / 9.5 remain `[ ]`. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 9.2 of 10 — budget happy path". Next: Step 9.3 — `tests/unit/briefing/test_budget_guard.py` (AC-1.4 + AC-1.5: Stage 1 first attempt reports 200 s elapsed; Stage 2's would-exceed check fires before dispatch and BGE `stage="budget"` raises; assert exactly 1 LLM call dispatched).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 9.1 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 9.1 (`tests/unit/briefing/test_failure_contract.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `tests/unit/briefing/test_failure_contract.py` (~250 lines, 5 tests) covering all four BGE stages plus the two pass-through pin tests:
- **Classification BGE (AC-3.2)**: 3 malformed-JSON attempts via `_runner_returning([_outcome(stdout="not json"), _outcome(stdout="still { broken"), _outcome(stdout="}{{ invalid")])` → `stage="classification"`, `attempt_count=3`, `cause` is `json.JSONDecodeError | ValueError`.
- **Synthesis BGE (AC-3.2)**: 1 valid classification followed by 3 blank Stage 2 attempts → `stage="synthesis"`, `attempt_count=3`. Blank stdout trips the 200-char `_STAGE2_SANITY_FLOOR`.
- **Post-validation BGE (AC-3.2)**: Stage 2 returns valid 6-section markdown with a `ghp_` + 36-A GitHub PAT embedded inside section ① body; after `append_disclaimer` runs, `leak_guard.scan` matches → `stage="post_validation"`, `attempt_count=1` (no retry per R6), `cause` is `ValueError`. Test asserts `"github_pat"` substring in cause string to pin the pattern-name surface (which u3 publisher's verify path may surface in operator alerts).
- **AC-3.4 programmer-error pass-through**: monkeypatch `pipeline.build_section_plan` to raise `KeyError("synthetic programmer error")`; classification succeeds, then KeyError propagates from `generate_briefing` UNWRAPPED. `pytest.raises(KeyError)` succeeds; `pytest.raises(BriefingGenerationError)` would NOT catch — pinned by the test's exact exception class.
- **AC-3.5 ValidationError pass-through**: monkeypatch `pipeline.parse_six_sections` to return `("", "ok", "ok", "ok", "ok", "ok")` (a "valid-shape" tuple but with empty body 1). `_synthesize`'s parse gate uses the same monkeypatched function so it accepts; `generate_briefing` then constructs `Briefing(market_summary="", ...)` which fails `Field(min_length=1)` and raises `pydantic.ValidationError`. Propagates unwrapped.
**Test infrastructure**:
- `_runner_returning(outcomes)` — builds a runner that pops canned `subprocess.CompletedProcess` outcomes in order; raises `AssertionError` (not `StopIteration`) on test setup mismatch.
- `_outcome(stdout, stderr, returncode)` — constructs a `CompletedProcess` with sensible defaults.
- `_valid_classification_stdout(item_count)` — emits a JSON object that passes `_parse_classification` for any item count.
- `_valid_stage2_markdown()` — produces a >200-char 6-section markdown with non-leaking Korean prose. Used by post-validation + ValidationError tests.
- **`_zero_backoff` autouse fixture**: monkeypatches `pipeline._BACKOFF_SCHEDULE` to `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Without this, classification BGE + synthesis BGE tests each take 10s wall-clock (FD R3 schedule = 0/2/8s sleeps). With it, all 5 tests run in 0.21s. Trade-off: the schedule numbers themselves are not pinned by these tests; that's a deliberate scope choice (see Step 8.5 audit — L2 deferred reasoning).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 9.5 (combined Step 9 review). Same pattern as Step 8.2/8.3/8.4: tests-only commit with the dedicated review at the end of the step.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 file auto-formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0 — tests live under `tests/`), pytest **412/412 passed in 4.78s** (+5 tests; zero regressions in the prior 407).

Delegated to general-purpose sub-agent for fresh-eyes review of `pipeline.py` (8.1) + `test_pipeline_unit.py` (8.2) + `test_pipeline_pbt.py` (8.3) + `test_pipeline_no_prompt_strings.py` (8.4) + the small Step 8 modification to `prompts.py`.
**Sub-agent verdict**: APPROVE_WITH_FIXES. 0 Critical / 2 High / 4 Medium / 4 Low / 3 TECH-DEBT candidates.
**High issues — APPLIED before commit**:
- **H1 — `parse_six_sections` silently fuses bodies on inline-duplicate headers** (`pipeline.py:199-204`). If LLM emits `## ② 전일 핵심 이슈` mid-prose in body ① (e.g., "the next section, ## ② ..."), `markdown.find` returns the inline position; real ② content gets fused into body ①. Fix: added `markdown.count(header) == 1` check after the missing-header check; raises `ValueError` with the offending header + occurrence count. Regression test `test_parse_six_sections_rejects_inline_duplicate_header` pins behavior.
- **H2 — Unicode normalization sensitivity (NFC vs NFD)** (`pipeline.py:200-204`). `STAGE2_SECTION_HEADERS` constants are NFC; if LLM emits NFD form (jamo decomposition), `str.find` returns -1 because Python string ops are codepoint-exact, not normalization-aware. A single transient NFD reply would burn all 3 retries. Fix: `markdown = unicodedata.normalize("NFC", markdown)` at top of `parse_six_sections`. Single-pass, zero behavioral change for already-NFC input. Regression test `test_parse_six_sections_normalizes_nfd_input_to_nfc` verifies an NFD-normalized briefing round-trips.
**Low issue — APPLIED**: **L3** — literal `{2, 3, 4, 5}` in field-validator error message would silently lie if `_VALID_SECTION_IDS` ever changed. Fix: built `valid_str = "{" + ", ".join(str(s) for s in sorted(_VALID_SECTION_IDS)) + "}"` so error text and constant cannot drift; deterministic sorted ordering preserves the existing `"{2, 3, 4, 5}"` substring assertion.
**Medium / Low items — DEFERRED with rationale** (per dev-investo skill review-results triage):
- **M1** (final-attempt budget exhaustion labeled `stage="synthesis"` not `stage="budget"`) — DEFERRED. Per agent: ordering is correct as written; you cannot pre-charge unknown elapsed. Current behavior is defensible per FD R3 (budget gate prevents *future dispatch*, not relabel of completed-but-over failures). No TECH-DEBT.
- **M2** (no `RecursionError` catch on adversarial JSON nesting) → **DEBT-008** (Low). Defense-in-depth; Claude doesn't emit deeply-nested JSON in normal operation.
- **M3** (`parse_six_sections` called twice — once as `_synthesize` gate, once for `generate_briefing` extraction) — DEFERRED. Both calls operate on the same immutable string; defensive redundancy is cheap and harmless. No TECH-DEBT.
- **M4** (`Briefing` validator vs `parse_six_sections` agreement) — VERIFIED no divergence. `reject_blank_preserve` is exactly `not value.strip() → raise`, matches `parse_six_sections`'s `if not body:` check. No fix needed.
- **L1** (`_executable_source` helper duplicated across two test files) → **DEBT-009** (Low).
- **L2** (`_BACKOFF_SCHEDULE` magic numbers not test-pinned) — DEFERRED. Inline FD R3 reference is sufficient.
- **L4** (no byte-exact JSON snapshot test for `serialize_items_for_prompt`) → **DEBT-007** (Medium). FakeClaudeRunner SHA-256 fixture key stability depends on serializer determinism that's currently correct but unpinned.
**Q1-Q8 specific questions answered**:
- Q1 (budget check ordering): correct as designed; M1 is labeling not behavior.
- Q2 (double-parse drift risk): impossible — same immutable string passed by reference.
- Q3 (validator could reject body parse accepted): no — both use `not value.strip()`.
- Q4 (JSON dumps determinism): yes for given input (Python ≥3.7 dict order + dict-literal field order + `+00:00` not `Z`); but NO test pins it → DEBT-007.
- Q5 (RecursionError on `json.loads`): real concern → DEBT-008.
- Q6 (`isoformat` format): verified `'2026-04-25T15:00:00+00:00'`; test correct.
- Q7 (PBT filter blind spot): the filter is too aggressive for production — disguises H1.
- Q8 (helper duplication): should move to `tests/_helpers/` → DEBT-009.
**L1 ordering verification (FD L1 step 9 vs 10)**: Confirmed: `pipeline.generate_briefing` (line 409 area) does `full_markdown = append_disclaimer(body_markdown)` THEN `hit = leak_guard_scan(full_markdown)`. The `DISCLAIMER` constant text contains no `@`, no `gh[pousr]_`, no `AKIA`, no `eyJ`, no `010-####-####`, no long base64-alphabet run ≥40 chars — verified safe. Korean compliance prose; no leak-guard false positives.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (58 files; `pipeline.py` auto-formatted to fix long-line break introduced by L3 fix), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0), pytest **407/407 passed in 7.61s** (+2 H1 + H2 regression tests added to `test_pipeline_unit.py`; zero regressions in the prior 405).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: 3 added (DEBT-007 Medium, DEBT-008 Low, DEBT-009 Low). 0 resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 8.5 complete; **Step 8 fully closed (8.1-8.5 all `[x]`)**. Plan summary: pipeline.py implemented + 36 tests across 3 test files (28 anchor + 5 PBT + 3 sentinel) + sub-agent review with all High issues fixed. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 8 of 10 — Step 8 fully closed". Next: Step 9 — `tests/unit/briefing/test_failure_contract.py` + `test_budget_happy_path.py` + `test_budget_guard.py` + `tests/integration/test_briefing_pipeline_poc.py` (FD L9 PoC against u1's recorded FOMC fixture).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 8.4 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8.4 (`tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_no_prompt_strings.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_no_prompt_strings.py` (~110 lines, 3 tests) using the `inspect.getsource` + AST-docstring-strip pattern (mirrors the `_executable_source` helper already in `test_claude_code.py`):
- **AC-5.2 sentinel grep**: `_executable_source(pipeline)` contains none of `"market-briefing classifier"`, `"market-briefing writer"`, `"Pre-grouped items"`, `"Section ID legend"`. Stripping docstrings via AST means the test fires only on prompt strings that actually flow through executable code paths — docstring discussions of "the market-briefing classifier" remain allowed.
- **AC-5.3 sentinel grep**: same check against `_executable_source(claude_code)`.
- **Tautology guard**: every sentinel must appear in `inspect.getsource(prompts)` — protects against a refactor that quietly drops a prompt anchor and leaves the two grep tests passing vacuously.
**Sentinel-set decision**: `## ① 요약` (and the other 5 Stage 2 section headers) are intentionally NOT in this test's sentinel set. As of Step 8.1, those headers are imported into `pipeline.py` via `STAGE2_SECTION_HEADERS` (the single-source-of-truth refactor that resolved the original AC-5.2 sentinel-grep failure). The file-read `test_prompts.py::test_prompt_sentinels_only_in_prompts` continues to enforce the rule on raw text where re-introduction of literal headers would matter.
**Coverage relationship to existing test**: complementary, not redundant. `test_prompts.py::test_prompt_sentinels_only_in_prompts` reads raw file text (catches docstrings + comments + executable code). The new `inspect.getsource`-based test strips docstrings + comments and tests only executable code. A regression that buries a prompt body inside a multi-line raw string assigned to a constant in `pipeline.py` trips both. A regression that mentions `"market-briefing writer"` in a `pipeline.py` docstring trips only the file-read version (correct — that's the broader rule). The two together pin the contract from both angles.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8.5. Same rationale as 8.2 / 8.3: tests-only commit; the dedicated combined Step 8 review lands at 8.5 (covering pipeline.py impl + 8.2 anchor tests + 8.3 PBT + 8.4 sentinel grep as a single review unit). With 8.4 shipped, every NFR AC currently scheduled for Step 8 is pinned.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 new file already formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0 — tests live under `tests/`), pytest **405/405 passed in 4.89s** (+3 new tests; zero regressions in the prior 402).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 8.4 complete. Plan checkbox 8.4 marked `[x]`; only 8.5 remains. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 8.4 of 10 — pipeline sentinel grep". Next: Step 8.5 — sub-agent code review focused on the retry-loop algorithm (does it correctly decrement the shared budget?), `parse_six_sections` Korean-numeral split logic, and the L1 ordering (disclaimer must come AFTER `_synthesize` returns and BEFORE `leak_guard.scan`).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 8.3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8.3 (`tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_pbt.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_pbt.py` (~180 lines, 5 PBTs each at 100 examples per AC-6.6) covering both serialize and parse round-trips:
- **AC-6.2 serialize shape PBT**: `json.loads(serialize(items))` is `list[dict]` of length `len(items)`; key set is exactly `{id, category, source, title, summary, url, ts}`; `raw_metadata` never present. Locks the FD R7 contract under arbitrary item lists (0..10 items per example).
- **AC-6.2 None-collapse PBT**: when `original.summary is None` (or pydantic normalized whitespace-only → None), serialized `summary == ""`. Same for `url`. When non-None, value matches `str(url)`. Confirms the prompt-stability rule for adapter-side absence sentinels.
- **AC-6.2 dense-ids PBT**: synthetic ids always `1..len(items)` in input order; locks Stage 1's contract.
- **AC-6.3 parse round-trip PBT**: synthetic markdown built from 6 hypothesis-generated non-blank bodies + the six `STAGE2_SECTION_HEADERS` parses back to each body's `.strip()` form. Hypothesis filter `_section_safe` rejects bodies containing ANY of the six exact section header strings (the only confusion vector for `markdown.find(header)`'s first-occurrence search; we do NOT need to forbid `## ` generically).
- **AC-6.3 companion canary**: parser always returns a 6-tuple of non-blank strings (regression sanity).
**Strategy design**:
- `_normalized_items` composite strategy uses printable-ASCII source-name alphabet (avoids exotic-whitespace + unicode-normalization edge cases not representative of real adapters), prefixes title with `"t-"` to ensure non-blank-stripped (matches `NormalizedItem._reject_blank` validator), summary is `None | text(min=1, max=60)` (whitespace-only summaries get pydantic-normalized to None internally — the test handles both branches), URL is `None | "https://example.com/a"` (a full HttpUrl strategy is overkill since the serializer only calls `str()`), and `published_at` is bounded to 2020-2030 UTC.
- `_BODY = text(min=1, max=100).filter(_section_safe)` — the filter is rarely hit because random hypothesis strings almost never contain `## ① 요약`-class Korean strings; no filter-too-much warnings observed.
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8.5 (combined Step 8 review). Same rationale as Step 8.2: tests-only commit; review of all of Step 8 (impl + 3 test files + sentinel grep) lands once at the end.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (1 new file already formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0 — tests live under `tests/`), pytest **402/402 passed in 4.51s** (+5 PBTs each at 100 examples; zero regressions in the prior 397).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 8.3 complete. Plan checkbox 8.3 marked `[x]`; 8.4 / 8.5 remain `[ ]`. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "Step 8.3 of 10 — pipeline PBT". Next: Step 8.4 — `tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_no_prompt_strings.py` (sentinel grep against `inspect.getsource(briefing.pipeline)` and `inspect.getsource(briefing.claude_code)` for AC-5.2 / AC-5.3 — already partially enforced by `test_prompts.py::test_prompt_sentinels_only_in_prompts`, but the plan calls for a dedicated test that uses `inspect.getsource` rather than file-reads, matching u1's no-prompt-leak pattern).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 8.2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8.2 (`tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_unit.py` anchor tests) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_unit.py` (~330 lines, 28 tests) covering the four pure helpers in `pipeline.py`:
- `serialize_items_for_prompt` (7 tests): empty → `"[]"`; full-shape key set; synthetic id from `enumerate(start=1)`; None summary/url → `""`; UTC isoformat ts via KST→prior-day 15:00 round-trip (locks timezone drift); `raw_metadata` excluded along with its keys; Korean characters preserved (locks `ensure_ascii=False`).
- `_parse_classification` (7 tests): happy round-trip; degenerate empty case; invalid section id → `ValidationError` (substring `{2, 3, 4, 5}`); unknown item id in assignments → `ValueError` mentioning bad id; unknown id in unassigned → same; malformed JSON → `json.JSONDecodeError`; extra top-level field → `ValidationError`.
- `build_section_plan` (4 tests): 3-item happy bucketing; `published_at desc` sort order pin; unassigned ids preserved as ordered tuple; frozen dataclass — assignment raises `FrozenInstanceError`.
- `parse_six_sections` (6 tests): happy 6-tuple of stripped bodies; tuple-of-six type pin; missing header rejection (names the missing header); blank body rejection; whitespace-only body rejection; out-of-order headers (② / ③ swapped) rejection.
- `ClassificationResult` shape (3 tests): frozen — assignment raises `ValidationError`; `extra="forbid"` enforced on `model_validate`; constructor path (not just parse path) enforces section-id constraint.
- Module surface pin (1 test): `ClassificationResult`, `SectionPlan`, `build_section_plan`, `generate_briefing`, `parse_six_sections`, `serialize_items_for_prompt` are all exposed.
**Test fixture style**: A small `_item(...)` keyword-only helper builds `NormalizedItem` instances with sensible defaults (UTC noon, `category="news"`, etc.) — matches u1's pattern (`tests/unit/sources/test_aggregator.py`). One test constructs `NormalizedItem` directly to populate `raw_metadata` (the helper doesn't expose that field, since 99% of tests don't need it).
**Sub-agent code review**: DEFERRED to Step 8.5 per the plan's structure — Step 8 is reviewed once as a whole (impl + anchor tests + PBT + sentinel grep). Matches the plan's explicit checkbox layout (8.5: "Sub-agent code review — focus on the retry-loop algorithm, parse_six_sections regex/split logic, and L1 ordering"). No source code changes in 8.2, so an isolated sub-agent pass on tests-only would have low signal.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (56 files; +1 = test_pipeline_unit.py auto-formatted on creation), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +0 — tests live under `tests/` and are out of strict-mypy scope), pytest **397/397 passed in 4.12s** (+28 new tests; zero regressions in the prior 369).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 8.1 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 8.1 (`src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py` implementation) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created `src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py` (~450 lines) implementing the full two-stage pipeline: `ClassificationResult` (pydantic, frozen, extra="forbid", section-id constraint via `field_validator` + `_VALID_SECTION_IDS = frozenset({2,3,4,5})`); `SectionPlan` (frozen dataclass); pure helpers `serialize_items_for_prompt` (FD R7 — `json.dumps(ensure_ascii=False)`, raw_metadata excluded, None→"", UTC isoformat ts), `_parse_classification` (strict JSON + id-set check), `build_section_plan` (sorts by `published_at desc`), `parse_six_sections` (split on six headers, raises on missing/blank/out-of-order — out-of-order is defensive beyond plan); async stages `_classify` / `_synthesize` (FD R3 retry: 3 attempts × 0/2/8s backoff × 120s per-call, shared `RetryBudget`); `generate_briefing` (atomic L1 + R12: classify → plan → synthesize → parse → append_disclaimer → leak_guard.scan → `Briefing`).
**Cross-module change**: Moved `STAGE2_SECTION_HEADERS: Final[tuple[str, ...]]` from a private constant in `pipeline.py` into `prompts.py`, then re-imported. Reason: the AC-5.2 sentinel-grep test (Step 5) flagged `## ① 요약` in `pipeline.py` as a leaked prompt-body string. The headers ARE part of the Stage 2 output contract that `prompts.py` owns (the prompt instructs the LLM to emit them verbatim, and `parse_six_sections` splits on the same strings) — single source of truth resolves the boundary cleanly. `prompts.py` `__all__` extended.
**Docstring change**: `prompts.py` "Caller obligations (Step 8 wiring)" section rewritten as "Brace handling note". Original claimed callers must escape `{` / `}` in user content before substitution. Verified empirically that `str.format` inserts substituted values as literals — `"a {x} b".format(x="{y}") == "a {y} b"`, no recursive expansion. So `pipeline.py` does NOT need to escape braces; the rewrite documents this correctly.
**Plan-vs-impl divergences (acceptable)**: (1) `ClassificationResult` uses `field_validator` + `frozenset` instead of plan-suggested `Field(ge=2, le=5)` — identical effect for ints, clearer error message. (2) `_classify` / `_synthesize` import prompts at module level, no `prompts` parameter — loses an injection seam but matches single-prompt-set reality. (3) `parse_six_sections` adds an out-of-order check beyond plan — defensive bonus. (4) `generate_briefing` calls `parse_six_sections` twice (once inside `_synthesize` as gate, once at top level for body extraction) — minor redundancy, acceptable.
**Safety check**: Verified `leak_guard.scan(DISCLAIMER) is None` — the post-disclaimer-append leak scan does not false-positive on the disclaimer's own Korean text. Order in `generate_briefing` (append THEN scan) is safe.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (55 files; pipeline.py auto-formatted to collapse two long-line breaks), mypy --strict ✅ (22 source files; +1 from Step 7's 21), pytest **369/369 passed in 3.51s** (no regressions; no new tests yet — 8.2 anchor tests / 8.3 PBT / 8.4 sentinel-grep / 8.5 sub-agent review still pending).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 7 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 7 (`FakeClaudeRunner` + AC-6.5 grep) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created: `tests/_helpers/fake_claude_runner.py` (217 lines) — `FakeClaudeRunner` class implementing the `ClaudeRunner` Protocol from Step 6: extracts prompt via `args.index("-p")`, computes fixture key as `sha256(prompt)[:16]` (16 hex = 64 bits, ~5e-15 collision at 1k fixtures), looks up `<fixture_dir>/<key>.json` for replay; in live-record mode (`INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1`) dispatches to the injected `subprocess_runner` (defaults to `subprocess.run`), measures elapsed via `time.monotonic`, and writes the JSON fixture atomically via tmp-file + `os.replace`. Includes `FixtureMissingError` (Exception subclass) carrying `prompt_prefix` (200-char), `key`, `expected_path`. Args-shape guard surfaces clear `ValueError` if caller passes malformed args. `tests/unit/briefing/test_fake_claude_runner.py` (333 lines, 16 tests) — replay round-trip (matching CompletedProcess fields, nonzero returncode, missing-field defaults) + missing-fixture diagnostic (key + prompt prefix + 200-char truncation + INVESTO_LIVE_LLM=1 hint) + live-record (with stubbed subprocess to avoid spawning real claude in tests; round-trip record-then-replay; mkdir parents=True; strict `== "1"` env var match) + default fixture dir resolution + public surface checks + 2 args-shape guard tests + atomic-write `.tmp` cleanup test + AST-based AC-6.5 grep test.
**AC-6.5 enforcement design**: AST walk over every `tests/**/*.py` file (excluding the helper itself) checks for `subprocess.run/Popen([..., "claude", ...])` call patterns. AST-based — false-positive immune to mere mentions of `"claude"` in arg-shape assertions like `assert captured == ["claude", "-p", ...]`. Aliased imports (`from subprocess import run`) are not detected (agent L3); accepted trade-off for false-positive immunity.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 6 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-29T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 6 (`claude_code.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created: `src/investo/briefing/claude_code.py` (192 lines) — `RetryBudget` dataclass with `slots=True` (FD L4: cumulative `elapsed_s` shared across stages; methods `record(seconds)`, `would_exceed(next_attempt_estimate_s)` using `>=` inclusive boundary, `check_or_raise(*, stage)` raising `BGE(stage="budget")`) + `ClaudeRunner` Protocol (test seam matching `subprocess.run`'s signature: `args, *, capture_output, text, timeout`) + `_default_runner` (only call site of real `subprocess.run` with list-form args + `shell` not set) + `call_claude_code` async wrapper (dispatches via `asyncio.to_thread` so event loop stays responsive; wraps `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` into `SubprocessOutcome(returncode=124, stderr="<timeout after Ns>")` rather than raising — caller's retry loop inspects outcome) + module docstring documenting subprocess hygiene rules (R2). `tests/unit/briefing/test_claude_code.py` (294 lines, 21 tests) — 7 RetryBudget tests (default state, accumulation, would_exceed below/at-threshold/above, check_or_raise no-raise/at-threshold/over-budget) + 7 call_claude_code behavior tests (success, non-zero returncode passthrough, prompt arg passthrough, default + custom timeout propagation, TimeoutExpired wrapping, event-loop non-blocking via asyncio.gather with parallel_marker coroutine) + 4 source self-checks via AST-stripped grep helper `_executable_source` (no `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` literal in executable code, no `shell=True`, no string-form subprocess, no Anthropic SDK import) + 2 module-shape tests (`__all__` content, FD R3 default constants).
**AST-strip helper rationale**: naive `inspect.getsource(cc)` grep false-positives on the module docstring's negative-context mentions of `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` ("consumed by the CLI binary, not by us") and `shell=True` ("Never shell=True"). The helper strips top-level + nested function/class docstrings via `ast.walk` + `ast.unparse`, leaving only executable code for the grep. Comments are also stripped (ast.unparse drops them). Documented in helper docstring.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (52 files already formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (21 source files; +1 from Step 5's 20), pytest **353/353 passed in 3.90s** (+21 new tests).
**Sub-agent code review** (general-purpose, fresh-eyes): **APPROVE (ship as-is)**; 0 Critical / 0 High / 2 Mediums / 3 Lows + 2 TECH-DEBT candidates. APPLIED — M2 (concurrency-test margin bumped from 0.18s to 0.25s for CI thread-scheduling jitter) + DEBT-006 registered (cancellation propagation gap; M1 deferred to u5 orchestrator wait_for pattern finalization). KEPT — L1 (`del stage` in check_or_raise — defensible API symmetry), L2 (`stderr=None` defensive coercion — harmless, aligns with non-optional `SubprocessOutcome.stderr`), L3 (nested-docstring recursion concern — `ast.walk(tree)` already handles it; agent's L3 was incorrect, no action).
**TECH-DEBT changes**: **+DEBT-006 (Low)** — `call_claude_code` cancellation propagation gap: when awaiter is cancelled (e.g. upstream `asyncio.wait_for`), the `asyncio.to_thread`-wrapped subprocess continues running until its own `timeout=` fires. Acceptable for v1 (per-call timeout enforces bound; kernel reaps the orphan child), but worth re-evaluating when u5 orchestrator's wait_for wrapping pattern is finalized. Suggested fix would migrate to `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` (~2h effort + FakeClaudeRunner refactor). Documented in `docs/TECH-DEBT.md`. None resolved.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 5 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 5 (`prompts.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created: `src/investo/briefing/prompts.py` (140 lines) — 4 `Final[str]` constants (`STAGE1_SYSTEM` with classifier role + JSON schema + section-ID legend per FD L2; `STAGE1_USER_TEMPLATE` with `{items_json}` placeholder; `STAGE2_SYSTEM` with the 6 fixed Korean section headers + R8 Korean+ticker rule + R5 disclaimer exclusion + R6 PII prohibition per FD L3; `STAGE2_USER_TEMPLATE` with `{grouped_sections}` + `{unassigned}` + `{target_date}` placeholders) + module docstring documenting (a) substitution convention via `str.format(**kwargs)`, (b) SYSTEM-never-formatted invariant, (c) caller's brace-escaping obligation for `grouped_sections` payload, (d) defense-in-depth layering with `leak_guard.scan`. `tests/unit/briefing/test_prompts.py` (200 lines, 18 tests) — AC-5.1 4-constant non-empty Final[str] parametrize + Stage 1 anchors (role, schema, section-ID legend, sections 2-5, no ⑦ mention) + Stage 2 anchors (six fixed headers, R5 disclaimer-excluded, R8 Korean+ticker rule with concrete `AAPL`/`S&P 500` examples, PII prohibition) + USER template placeholder substitution round-trip + idempotence-under-repeat (catches leftover placeholders) + AC-5.2/5.3 sentinel-grep across `src/investo/briefing/*.py` excluding `prompts.py` itself + anti-tautology check + SYSTEM-never-formatted convention (`pytest.raises(KeyError, IndexError, ValueError)` on `STAGE1_SYSTEM.format()`) + cross-module collision check (`## ① 요약` not in `DISCLAIMER` to confirm sentinel grep won't false-flag disclaimer.py).
**Substitution model**: SYSTEM constants are concatenated as literals; USER templates use `str.format(**kwargs)` with documented placeholders. Pipeline (Step 8) merges via `f"{SYSTEM}

{USER_TEMPLATE.format(...)}"` — concatenation, not formatting. Stage 1 system has literal `{` / `}` in JSON schema example which would explode if `.format()`-ed; convention locked by test.

KEPT — L2 (`BriefingStage` Literal re-exported in `__all__` correctly). No new TECH-DEBT items. Notable agent verifications: `_truncate_stderr` byte safety analysis confirmed (`errors="ignore"` on UTF-8 drops only invalid trailing bytes; output always valid UTF-8); `from`-chain test correctly distinguishes Python builtin `__cause__` from manually-stored `cause` attribute; frozen+slots `(TypeError, AttributeError, FrozenInstanceError)` triple-tolerance is correct cross-version policy.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved.
**Status**: ✅ Step 4 complete. Plan checkboxes 4.1/4.2/4.3 all `[x]`. aidlc-state.md u2 briefing CG column updated to "4/10 — errors".

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 3 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 3 (`leak_guard.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created: `src/investo/briefing/leak_guard.py` (115 lines) — closed `_PATTERNS` tuple (FD R6 set in priority order: github_pat → aws_access_key → jwt → email → korean_phone → oauth_long_base64) + `_URL_CONTEXT_FILTERED` frozenset (only `oauth_long_base64` requires URL exclusion) + `_is_in_url_context` helper (200-char lookback, scheme verification) + `LeakGuardHit` NamedTuple (pattern_name + match_text truncated to 64 chars) + `scan(markdown) -> LeakGuardHit | None`; `tests/unit/briefing/test_leak_guard.py` (220 lines, 29 tests) — hit cases (parameterized for 5 PAT prefixes + 3 Korean phone formats; canonical example for AWS/JWT/email/oauth-base64) + miss cases (clean Korean prose, clean English ticker prose, base64 inside http(s) URL, room-number Korean, sub-threshold base64) + URL-context boundary tests (whitespace breaks exclusion, 250-char filler outside lookback window) + Step 3 review-driven regression pins (ReDoS linear behavior, autolink `<URL>` exclusion, mailto flagged as email).
**FD R6 regex amendment per AC-D.4**: Email regex tightened from FD R6 literal `\S+@\S+\.\S+` to ReDoS-safe `[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+`. Reason: Step 3 sub-agent identified quadratic-backtracking risk on adversarial input where `\S+` and `\S+` overlap. Refinement is semantically equivalent for valid email matches (an `@` in the local part is theoretically valid syntax per RFC 5321 quoted-local-part, but never observed in real LLM-generated prose). Inline comment in `leak_guard.py` documents the change with audit-log timestamp; regression test `test_email_long_no_dot_completes_quickly` pins linear behavior on `("!"*5000) + "@" + ("?"*5000)` adversarial input (chars chosen to NOT trigger any other R6 pattern, isolating the email regex's behavior). This is the documented AC-D.4 process: code change + test update + audit entry, all three in the same commit.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (46 files already formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (18 source files; +1 from Step 2's 17), pytest **294/294 passed in 3.26s** (+29 new tests).
**Sub-agent code review** (general-purpose, fresh-eyes): **APPROVE_WITH_FIXES**; 0 Critical / 2 Highs / 1 Medium / 3 Lows + 2 TECH-DEBT candidates. APPLIED — H1 (email regex ReDoS, see above), H2 (autolink markdown `<URL>` form regression test), M2 (mailto: behavior pinning test). SKIPPED — L1 (URL-safe base64 alphabet `-_` not covered — design observation, matches R6 verbatim, defer per AC-D.5 evidence pattern), L2 (199/200-char boundary test — cosmetic), L3 (codepoint vs byte slice — sound for ASCII-only patterns). M1 (trailing punctuation in match excerpts) implicitly resolved by H1's `[^\s@]` refinement. TD-leak-guard-1 applied inline as H1 fix; TD-leak-guard-2 (URL-safe base64 expansion) deferred — not registered in TECH-DEBT.md until real false-negative evidence emerges.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 2 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 2 (`disclaimer.py`) of u2 briefing Code Generation. Created: `src/investo/briefing/disclaimer.py` (62 lines) — `DISCLAIMER: Final[str]` (5-line Korean text per FD R5, byte-identical with what u3's `verify_disclaimer` will substring-check) + private `_ANCHOR` + pure `append_disclaimer(markdown)` (idempotence anchored on `## ⑦ 면책조항` header per R5; appends `

` + DISCLAIMER if anchor absent); `tests/unit/briefing/test_disclaimer.py` (101 lines, 9 anchor tests covering DISCLAIMER shape + AC-4.2 substring + AC-4.3 last-section anchor + AC-4.5 Final[str] + idempotence example cases including the LLM-hallucination drifted-body case); `tests/unit/briefing/test_disclaimer_pbt.py` (51 lines, 3 PBTs: unconditional idempotence, conditional presence for anchor-less inputs, unconditional anchor-always canary).
**Implementation choice — anchor-on-header**: FD R5 explicitly chose to anchor idempotence on the section header substring, not the full DISCLAIMER body. The "drifted body" pathological case (input contains anchor but with wrong/hallucinated body text) is intentionally NOT fixed by u2 — u3 publisher's `verify_disclaimer` does the strict full-substring check and blocks publish on drift. Operator gets alerted via NFR-003 / FR-007 path. This is the documented defense-in-depth pattern.
**PBT conditioning decision**: NFR doc AC-6.1 lists "Idempotence" + "Presence" as PBT properties unconditionally, but unconditional "DISCLAIMER in append_disclaimer(x)" does NOT hold under R5 anchor-on-header semantics (an input containing only the anchor passes through unchanged → result lacks full DISCLAIMER). Resolved: Idempotence is the unconditional PBT (AC-4.1, AC-6.1); Presence is conditioned on `_ANCHOR not in x` (the meaningful "no disclaimer yet → append it" invariant); a third unconditional PBT pins `_ANCHOR in result` as a regression canary. Documented in PBT docstrings + session log.
**Quality gate**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅ (44 files already formatted), mypy --strict ✅ (17 source files; +1 from Step 1's 16), pytest **265/265 passed in 3.03s** (+13 new tests: 9 anchor + 3 PBT + 1 type check; 3 PBTs each ran 100 examples).
**Sub-agent code review** (general-purpose, fresh-eyes): **APPROVE**; 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium / 4 Lows + 1 verification. L1 (DEBT-001 registry verification) — confirmed present in `docs/TECH-DEBT.md`. L2 (derive `_ANCHOR` from `DISCLAIMER`) — skipped per R5 explicit decoupling rationale. L3 (test-side `ANCHOR` literal duplication) — skipped (black-box virtue, agent agreed). L4 (regex intent comment in test_disclaimer.py) — APPLIED.
**TECH-DEBT changes**: None added, none resolved. DEBT-001 ("Briefing model lacks disclaimer ∈ rendered_markdown invariant") remains open and is referenced from the disclaimer.py module docstring as the future generalization target.

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Step 1 COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Executed Step 1 (bootstrap) of u2 briefing Code Generation per `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u2-briefing-code-generation-plan.md`. Created skeletons: `src/investo/briefing/__init__.py` (docstring placeholder + empty `__all__`); `tests/unit/briefing/__init__.py` (empty); `tests/unit/briefing/conftest.py` (placeholder docstring for later shared fixtures); `tests/_helpers/__init__.py` (empty — FakeClaudeRunner home per TS-9); `tests/fixtures/llm/.gitkeep` (empty — TS-8 fixture-key directory). Audited `pyproject.toml`: confirmed deps `pydantic>=2.0`, `httpx>=0.27`, `defusedxml>=0.7`, `bleach>=6` (unchanged from u1 closeout); dev deps unchanged; no `anthropic` entry (grep clean). **Zero new external dependencies introduced** — matches `tech-stack-decisions.md` cumulative delta = 0.

**Sub-agent review**: SKIPPED per u1 Step 1 precedent — diff is docstring placeholders + empty `__init__.py` files only; substantive sub-agent reviews resume at Step 2 (`disclaimer.py`).
**Decisions logged**: (1) `tests/_helpers/` (underscore-prefix) over `tests/helpers/` — avoids accidental pytest test collection from this support-only package; (2) `tests/fixtures/llm/` (top-level) over `tests/unit/briefing/fixtures/` — LLM fixtures are referenced by both unit and integration tests (Step 9 PoC), so the top-level home is correct per TS-8; (3) `__all__: list[str] = []` (empty list with explicit type annotation) — placeholder until Step 10 finalizes the public re-export surface.
**User Input**: "approve" (Code Generation plan approval received 2026-04-28).

## Construction — u2 briefing — Code Generation Plan READY (awaiting approval)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Generated `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/u2-briefing-code-generation-plan.md` — 10 numbered steps, each with `[ ]` checkboxes, mirroring u1's plan structure. Steps: (1) bootstrap — confirm zero new deps + skeleton dirs; (2) `disclaimer.py` — DISCLAIMER constant + idempotent `append_disclaimer` + PBT for AC-4.1/4.2/4.3 + AC-6.1; (3) `leak_guard.py` — R6 regex set + hit/miss calibration tests for AC-6.4/7.3; (4) `errors.py` — `BriefingGenerationError` (E4) + `SubprocessOutcome` (E5) + 1024-byte stderr cap test for AC-7.4; (5) `prompts.py` — 4 `Final[str]` constants + sentinel-grep test scaffolding for AC-5.1; (6) `claude_code.py` — `RetryBudget` (FD L4) + `call_claude_code` subprocess wrapper (asyncio.to_thread, list-form only) + token-not-in-code self-check for AC-2.5/7.2; (7) `tests/_helpers/fake_claude_runner.py` + INVESTO_LIVE_LLM record mode + AC-6.5 grep; (8) `pipeline.py` — `classify` + `_synthesize` + `generate_briefing` + R7 `serialize_items_for_prompt` + E3 `build_section_plan` + `parse_six_sections` + 2 PBTs for AC-6.2/6.3 + sentinel-grep test for AC-5.2/5.3; (9) failure-contract tests for AC-3.2/3.4/3.5 + budget tests for AC-1.1/1.4/1.5 + integration PoC against u1's recorded FOMC RSS fixture (FD L9) for AC-4.4/7.5; (10) `scripts/check_no_anthropic_sdk.py` (AC-2.2/2.3 + AC-7.1/7.6 — same grep) + CONTRIBUTING.md updates + closeout summary with full 49-AC traceability.

## Construction — u2 briefing — NFR Requirements Stage COMPLETE ✅
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Generated 2 NFR Requirements artifacts under `aidlc-docs/construction/u2-briefing/nfr-requirements/`:
- `nfr-requirements.md` — 49 testable ACs across 8 sections: NFR-001 share (5 ACs — `generate_briefing` ≤ 300 s wall-clock cap, shared RetryBudget across stages, two pinning tests for happy path + budget-guard fire); NFR-002 (5 ACs — repo-wide CI grep `scripts/check_no_anthropic_sdk.py` for `from anthropic` / `import anthropic` / `anthropic` in deps + `shell=True` patterns + string-form subprocess; `briefing/claude_code.py` is the only LLM call site; `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` not in code); NFR-003 (5 ACs — failure contract pinning all four BGE stages classification/synthesis/post_validation/budget; type-system AC for `-> Briefing` non-Optional return; programmer-error pass-through preserves KeyError/AttributeError/TypeError; pydantic ValidationError not wrapped); NFR-004 (6 ACs — disclaimer idempotence PBT, exact-substring presence, last-section anchor, `Briefing.rendered_markdown` substring guarantee, `Final[str]` constant, cross-unit boundary deferred to u3); NFR-005 (5 ACs — `briefing/prompts.py` constants + `str.format`, `pipeline.py` and `claude_code.py` contain no prompt body strings, no template engine dep); NFR-006 (6 ACs — PBT for `append_disclaimer` idempotence + `serialize_items_for_prompt` round-trip + `parse_six_sections` round-trip; `leak_guard.scan` example-based with hit/miss calibration; FakeClaudeRunner-only test path; ≥ 100 examples per PBT); NFR-007 (7 ACs — subprocess list-form, token not in code, R6 regex set pinned, stderr 1024-byte cap, `<script>` belt-and-braces, no `shell=True`, no eval/pickle.loads/exec); drift (5 ACs — CI tests permanent, SDK grep permanent, public-surface change triggers `/code-review git`, leak-guard regex add/remove requires test+audit-log, runtime metrics deferred). Full trace map links every NFR to FD R1-R12 + DEBT-001 cross-reference.
- `tech-stack-decisions.md` — 10 TS entries, all stdlib or already-locked: TS-1 subprocess (list-form only), TS-2 hashlib.sha256[:16] for fixture keys, TS-3 stdlib json (no orjson/ujson), TS-4 time.monotonic for RetryBudget, TS-5 stdlib datetime + zoneinfo, TS-6 stdlib logging (defer structlog), TS-7 str.format-based templating in `briefing/prompts.py` (rejecting jinja2/pyyaml/mako/chevron — Q5 decision), TS-8 JSON fixture format `tests/fixtures/llm/<sha256[:16]>.json`, TS-9 in-house `FakeClaudeRunner` (rejecting pytest-subprocess + unittest.mock.patch on subprocess), TS-10 `asyncio.to_thread` over `create_subprocess_exec` (no streaming need per FD L8). **Cumulative dep delta: ZERO new external deps** — u2 is stdlib + already-locked project core. Comparison table to u1's deps shows complementary surface areas (u1: httpx + defusedxml + bleach for HTTP/parse/sanitize; u2: subprocess + hashlib for LLM/disclaimer/leak-guard).
**Discovery questions (Q1-Q9)**: All answered "A" (with Q1 carrying a rationale that paraphrases option A's body — 5 min upper bound is reasonable, retry budget already capped at 5 min). Ambiguity check passed; no follow-up questions needed.
**Key NFR pinning vs FD coverage**: FD R1-R12 already concretized retry counts, leak-guard regex set, fixture mechanism, disclaimer text, and SDK ban. NFR Requirements layer adds: (a) testable AC for the 300 s budget cap (FD R3 said "5 min" without specifying the test shape); (b) repo-wide CI grep scope (FD R2 was unit-scoped); (c) prompt templating decision via `prompts.py` constants (FD showed inline skeletons but didn't pin location); (d) PBT scope = idempotence + JSON round-trip + section-parse round-trip (FD didn't address PBT for u2); (e) subprocess hygiene grep + stderr cap + `<script>` belt-and-braces (FD R2 mentioned `shell=True` as forbidden but not as CI-enforced).
**User Input**: "yes" (proceed with plan) → "approve" (NFR Requirements stage close, Continue to Next Stage).
**AI Response**: "Generated 2 NFR Requirements artifacts; presented standard 2-option AIDLC completion; user approved 'Continue to Next Stage'."
**Status**: ✅ NFR Requirements stage complete and approved (2026-04-28). aidlc-state.md u2 briefing NFR Requirements column = ✅ Complete. Plan file's 4 checkboxes all `[x]`. Next stage = Code Generation (per execution-plan: EXECUTE; NFR Design + Infrastructure Design SKIP per project rules).

## Extension Opt-in Decisions
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-26T00:00:00Z
**Decisions**:
- Security Baseline: **DECLINED** — Reason: 본인용 도구, 민감 데이터 없음, public repo 운영. 시크릿은 GitHub Secrets로 충분.
- Property-Based Testing: **PARTIAL** — Reason: 데이터 변환·직렬화 정확성은 PBT가 효과적이지만 전면 적용은 과함. 순수 함수 및 직렬화 round-trip에만 적용.

## Cross-Check — u1 sources — Compliance report
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-28T00:00:00Z (from session of 2026-04-27 stage-completion auto-action)
**Action**: Created docs/cross-checks/2026-04-27-u1-sources.md (first cross-check artifact for the project). Verified u1 sources implementation against docs/requirements.md FR-001, US-001/US-008/US-009 (u1-slice), and the 30 NFR ACs.
**Result**: 100% of u1's design contract fulfilled. 11/14 items ✅ Complete, 1 ⚠️ Partial (GAP-001 — only 1 of 6 source categories has an adapter; framework supports all but ships fomc-rss as PoC), 2 🔄 Deferred per execution-plan (NFR Design + Infrastructure Design).
**GAP-001 disposition**: Recorded as backlog item (5 adapter PRs remaining for MVP usefulness), NOT TECH-DEBT — this is a known scope decision (u1 = framework + reference adapter), not technical debt.
**User Input**: "yes" (run cross-check after u1 close)
**AI Response**: "Cross-check passed with 1 documented Partial; 0 critical gaps. Recommended sign-off + backlog the 5 missing adapters."
**Status**: Cross-check report committed (`ce6af6a`); u1 sources stage CLOSED is sign-off-ready.
**Context**: Unit-completion auto-action triggered after u1 sources Code Generation Step 10 closeout.

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 9 Complete (`__init__.py` + plugin contract)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Populated src/investo/sources/__init__.py — `from . import fomc_rss  # noqa: F401` for adapter discovery (triggers @register at first package import per FD §E2 / R2), public re-exports of SourceAdapter / SourceFetchError / list_sources / fetch_all / FetchWindow, `__all__` listing exactly that 5-name surface, module docstring documenting NFR AC-5.4 4-step procedure for adding new adapters. Created tests/unit/sources/test_plugin_contract.py (7 tests with autouse-fixture override that re-registers production adapters after conftest's clear) covering AC-5.2 drift guard, +1 stub meaningfulness, AC-5.3 duplicate-name with production slug, `__all__` lock, internal-helper non-leak, re-export identity.
**Code review**: Sub-agent APPROVE; 0 Critical/High/Medium, 4 Lows (L1 "4-line" wording — skipped per NFR AC-5.4 phrasing; L2 merge tests — skipped for diagnostic clarity; L3 bump-comment near EXPECTED_ADAPTER_COUNT — applied; L4 actual `import *` test — skipped, `__all__` is the canonical contract). No TECH-DEBT.
**User Input**: "yes" (Step 9 approval)
**AI Response**: "Applied L3 (bump-when-adding comment); skipped L1, L2, L4 as cosmetic. No new TECH-DEBT."

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 8 Complete (`fomc_rss.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/sources/fomc_rss.py (FomcRssAdapter with @register, name="fomc-rss", category="calendar", _FEED_URL=federalreserve.gov/feeds/press_all.xml, async fetch via retry_get + defusedxml parse + per-entry normalization). Recorded real one-off network call to capture tests/unit/sources/fixtures/api/fomc-rss/feed.xml (14 KB) + meta.json. Created tests/unit/sources/test_fomc_rss.py (13 tests covering AC-7.2/7.3/7.4 + edge cases) and tests/unit/sources/test_xml_safety.py (2 grep tests pinning AC-7.6). Added types-defusedxml>=0.7 to dev deps.
**FD-vs-implementation divergence (ratified)**: FD L6 originally listed feed as "Atom 1.0" with field mapping (title ← <title>, summary ← <summary>, url ← <link rel='alternate'>, published_at ← <updated>). Real feed inspection at recording time revealed it is **RSS 2.0** with different element names (<item> not <entry>; <description> not <summary>; <link> as plain text not <link rel='alternate'>) and RFC 822 dates (<pubDate>) instead of RFC 3339 (<updated>). Implementation parses RSS 2.0 per the actual feed shape; FD L6 was updated in this same change to match reality with a "Format correction (Step 8)" callout.
**Code review**: Sub-agent APPROVE_WITH_NOTES; 0 Critical/High, 2 Mediums (M1 naive-pubDate test partially vacuous — applied: tightened to `assert items == []`; M2 _normalize_entry: Any — skipped after verifying agent's proposed `defusedxml.ElementTree.Element` import doesn't exist at runtime, current Any is documented + tested) + 6 Lows (L1 NBSP test skipped; L2 category comment applied; L3 AC-7.5 grep deferred to Step 10; L4 boundary tests for 280/281 truncation applied; L5 grep regex extended to include xml.parsers.expat applied; L6 defusedxml positive guard tightened to regex applied) + doc note (FD L6 update applied).
**User Input**: "yes" (Step 8 approval); "fix-all-recommended" (apply 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; skip 2)
**AI Response**: "Applied M1, L2, L4, L5, L6, FD L6 doc update. Skipped M2 (after verifying agent's proposed import path doesn't work). All 6 Lows + 1 Medium addressed; 1 Medium intentionally skipped with rationale."
**Verification**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict src/ ✅, pytest 241/241 (101 models + 22 window + 42 retry + 25 sanitize + 13 protocol + 12 registry + 11 aggregator + 13 fomc_rss + 2 xml_safety).
**Status**: Step 8 complete; aidlc-state.md updated to "Step 8/10 ✅"; FD L6 corrected (Atom→RSS 2.0); types-defusedxml added to dev deps; no new TECH-DEBT.

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 7 Complete (`aggregator.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/sources/aggregator.py (`async def fetch_all(target_date)` opening shared `httpx.AsyncClient`, building `FetchWindow.from_kst_date`, dispatching all `list_sources()` adapters concurrently via `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)`; per-result loop: SourceFetchError → WARNING log + skip; other BaseException → re-raise; list → flatten; early-return on empty registry). Created tests/unit/sources/test_aggregator.py (11 tests covering AC-3.1-3.5 + programmer-error propagation) and tests/unit/sources/test_fetch_all_budget.py (2 timing tests covering AC-1.1 + concurrency proof). Extracted duplicated `_isolate_registry` autouse fixture to tests/unit/sources/conftest.py (was in 3 test files; now 1).
**Side-fix during quality gate**: hypothesis surfaced a pre-existing NaN bug in `_parse_retry_after` (Step 3) — `"NaN"` parsed to `float('nan')` and bypassed compute_sleep's `[0, max_retry_after_s]` invariant (NaN comparisons return False). Added `math.isfinite` guard in `_retry.py` + 4 regression tests (NaN/Infinity/-Infinity/inf → None).
**Code review**: Sub-agent APPROVE_WITH_NOTES; 0 Critical/High, 2 Mediums (M1 BaseException scope documentation; M2 log source_name choice — judgment call) + 3 Lows (L3 concurrency-bound bump; L4 conftest extraction; L5 unused fixture) + 1 TECH-DEBT (printf-style log vs L5 structured-fields spec).
**User Input**: "yes" (Step 7 approval); "fix all" (apply all 5 suggestions + register DEBT-005)
**AI Response**: "Applied: M1 inline comment confirming BaseException catch is deliberate; M2 inline comment justifying `result.source_name` choice (surfaces R8 violations as debug signal); L3 bumped 0.6 → 0.75 for slow-CI headroom; L4 extracted `_isolate_registry` autouse fixture to tests/unit/sources/conftest.py (removed from test_aggregator.py / test_fetch_all_budget.py / test_registry.py); DEBT-005 registered. Side-fix: NaN bug in `_parse_retry_after` patched with math.isfinite + 4 regression tests."
**Verification**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict src/ ✅, pytest 226/226 (101 models + 22 window + 42 retry + 25 sanitize + 13 protocol + 12 registry + 11 aggregator).
**Status**: Step 7 complete; aidlc-state.md updated to "Step 7/10 ✅"; DEBT-005 added (Low: printf-style log line); _retry.py NaN fix included.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — u1 sources, Step 7 of 10

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 6 Complete (`_registry.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/sources/_registry.py (module-level `_ADAPTERS: dict[str, SourceAdapter] = {}`, `register` class decorator with TypeVar-bound generic preserving concrete type, duplicate-check before dict mutation raising `RuntimeError("duplicate source name: ...")`, `list_sources` returning fresh list copy each call, `_clear_for_test` for fixture isolation) + tests/unit/sources/test_registry.py (12 tests with autouse snapshot/restore fixture covering: happy-path register; decorator transparency; singleton-instance behavior; insertion-order preservation; empty initial state; duplicate-name RuntimeError; error message slug presence; failed registration does NOT replace existing entry; mutation safety of `list_sources` return; fresh list each call; `_clear_for_test` empties registry; `_clear_for_test` allows re-registration).
**Code review**: Sub-agent APPROVE; 0 Critical/High/Medium, 3 Lows (L1 PEP 695 syntax — needs 3.12+, skipped; L2 cosmetic test arg nit, skipped; L3 docstring cross-reference, skipped). No TECH-DEBT.
**User Input**: "yes" (Step 6 approval)
**AI Response**: "All Lows skipped per reviewer's `Ship it` bottom-line. No new TECH-DEBT."
**Verification**: ruff ✅, ruff format ✅, mypy --strict src/ ✅, pytest 211/211 (101 models + 22 window + 38 retry + 25 sanitize + 13 protocol + 12 registry).

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 5 Complete (`protocol.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/sources/protocol.py (canonical home for `SourceFetchError` — relocated from _retry.py; widened `cause` type to `BaseException | None` per FD §E4 — and `SourceAdapter` Protocol with `ClassVar[str] name`, `ClassVar[Category] category`, `async fetch(client, window)`). Updated _retry.py to `from investo.sources.protocol import SourceFetchError` with `__all__` re-export for backward compat. Created tests/unit/sources/test_protocol.py (13 tests covering exception contract, Protocol introspection via `_is_protocol`/`_is_runtime_protocol`, re-export identity, stub-adapter mypy-side proof + async fetch).
**FD-vs-implementation divergence (ratified)**: FD §E1 / business-rules.md R3 specify `async def fetch(client, target_date: date)`; implementation uses `async def fetch(client, window: FetchWindow)` per the Step 5 plan. Rationale: the aggregator (Step 7) builds `FetchWindow.from_kst_date(target_date)` once and dispatches the prebuilt window to every adapter. With the FD signature, every adapter would re-derive the window from the date on entry — pure duplicated boilerplate. The window carries both `target_date` (preserved as a field) and the pre-computed UTC bounds, so no information is lost. The change is internal: `SourceAdapter` is a unit-internal Protocol; no other unit calls `fetch` directly (R6 — only the aggregator does). This entry is the canonical record of the deviation; FD remains the spec, audit log is the diff.

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 4 Complete (`_sanitize.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/sources/_sanitize.py (`strip_html` pipeline: bleach.clean tags=[]+strip=True → html.unescape → Unicode-aware whitespace collapse via `re.compile(r"\s+")`) + tests/unit/sources/test_sanitize.py (25 tests covering tag stripping, script/style neutralization, entity decoding, Korean+emoji preservation, whitespace normalization, lone `<` / comparison expressions, idempotence). Added `types-bleach>=6` to pyproject.toml dev deps for mypy strict.
**Code review**: Sub-agent APPROVE_WITH_NOTES; 0 Critical/High/Medium, 4 Lows (L1 redundant `strip_comments` kwarg — kept; L2 Unicode-whitespace comment — applied; L3 comparison-expression test — applied; L4 cross-reference reword — applied) + 1 TECH-DEBT (bleach in maintenance-mode; nh3 successor).
**User Input**: "yes" (Step 4 approval)
**AI Response**: "Applied L2/L3/L4 (Unicode-whitespace comment in source; comparison-expression test; reworded script-test comment to keep assertion local). Skipped L1 (defensible explicit kwarg). Registered DEBT-004 in docs/TECH-DEBT.md (Low priority — revisit on bleach EOL)."

## Construction — u1 sources — CG Step 3 Complete (`_retry.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/sources/_retry.py (RetryConfig frozen+slots dataclass with field validation, SourceFetchError exception class — to be relocated to protocol.py at Step 5, pure compute_sleep with Retry-After precedence, async retry_get wrapping inner loop in asyncio.wait_for for 60-s outer budget) + tests/unit/sources/test_retry.py (38 tests: 24 anchor + 2 PBT × 100 examples covering AC-6.3 + retry_get scenarios via httpx.MockTransport covering AC-1.2/7.1, FD R4/R5/R6).
**Surface divergence**: implementation uses explicit `url`/`headers`/`params` kwargs instead of plan §3.1's `request_kwargs` dict — better mypy strict ergonomics, sufficient for the FOMC adapter; documented in module docstring.
**Code review**: Sub-agent APPROVE; 0 Critical/High/Medium, 3 Lows (L1 dead `last_exc` variable, L2 cosmetic test-helper `type: ignore`, L3 already-documented surface choice) + 1 TECH-DEBT candidate (post-hoc 5 MB body cap — buffers full body before rejection).
**User Input**: "yes" (Step 3 approval)
**AI Response**: "Applied L1 — removed `last_exc` tracking, replaced defensive trailer with `raise AssertionError(...) # pragma: no cover`. Skipped L2/L3 (cosmetic / already-documented). Registered DEBT-003 in docs/TECH-DEBT.md (Low priority — re-evaluate when a non-RSS adapter lands)."

## Construction — models — Step 8 Complete + Stage Closeout
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Final quality gate run (ruff/format/mypy strict/pytest 101/101). Wrote aidlc-docs/construction/models/code/summary.md documenting files, public API, 11 key design decisions, code-review history (3 sub-agent rounds, all findings fixed in-step or registered as TECH-DEBT), NFR verification matrix, and pre-flight for u1 sources.
**Verification**: 5 source files (439 LOC), 5 test files (934 LOC), 101 tests pass.
**Status**: All 8 plan steps complete. `models` foundation Code Generation stage CLOSED OUT. Updated aidlc-state.md per-unit table to "✅ Complete (8/8)".
**Note**: `models` is foundation library, not a unit with stories — cross-check is N/A here. US-001~US-009 remain in progress; each closes when its consumer unit finishes Code Gen.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 8 of 8

## Construction — models — Step 7 Complete (PBT Round-trip)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created tests/unit/models/test_roundtrip.py with 6 hypothesis-based PBT tests covering every public model's model_dump_json ↔ model_validate_json equivalence. SendResult uses a @composite strategy to honor cross-field invariants; the other 5 use st.builds. 100 examples per model = 600 generated assertions. NFR-006 (PBT extension partial) satisfied for foundation.
**Verification**: ruff/format/mypy clean; pytest 101/101 (95 unit + 6 PBT). All round-trip properties hold across the bounded random sample.
**Code review**: Self-check (PBT tests exercising already-reviewed contracts). Strategies match model validators; ASCII-canonical inputs keep round-trip equivalence trivial.
**Status**: Step 7 complete; no new TECH-DEBT.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 7 of 8

---

## Construction — models — Step 6 Complete (Unit Tests)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created 95 unit tests across 4 files: tests/unit/models/test_items.py (26), test_briefing.py (31), test_results.py (34), test_init.py (4 — drift guard). Coverage exercises every validator, cross-field invariant, frozen/extra-field rule, UTF-16 boundary, and public API surface. One initial test failure (test_internal_helpers_not_re_exported) corrected: Python implicitly binds submodules so the test was over-specified; revised to check helper-name absence + __all__ exclusion (real contract).
**Verification**: ruff/format/mypy clean; pytest 95/95 pass.
**Code review**: Self-check (tests exercise already-reviewed contract). Coverage matrix in session log shows full breadth across all 7 model classes + drift guard.
**Status**: Step 6 complete; no new TECH-DEBT.
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 6 of 8

---

## Construction — models — Step 5 Complete (`models/__init__.py` public API)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Updated src/investo/models/__init__.py with explicit re-exports of 10 public names: Category, NormalizedItem, Briefing, BriefingNotification, TELEGRAM_MESSAGE_LIMIT, PipelineStatus, SendResult, FailureContext, PipelineResult, FailureStage. __all__ alphabetized. Internal _validators helpers confirmed private via star-import isolation test.
**Verification**: ruff/mypy clean; star import returns exactly __all__; all 6 model classes construct via top-level import.
**Code review**: Self-check only (re-export module, ~30 lines, trivial risk surface). No issues.
**Status**: Step 5 complete; no new TECH-DEBT items. DEBT-001/002 still open.

## Construction — models — Step 4 Complete (`models/results.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/models/results.py with PipelineStatus (StrEnum), SendResult (with cross-field model_validator), FailureContext, PipelineResult; extracted ensure_tz_aware to _validators.py; refactored items.py to consume the shared helper.
**Code review**: Sub-agent surfaced H1 (PipelineResult missing frozen=True), H2 (stages dict[str, str] keys unconstrained), M1 (SendResult contradictory ok/error pair), M2 (duration_seconds no upper bound), M3 (HttpUrl serialization footgun), L1 (ensure_tz_aware duplication), L2 (enum member docstrings), L3 (traceback_excerpt no length cap).
**User Input**: "fix all"
**AI Response**: "Applied: H1 frozen=True; H2 docstring clarifies free-form diagnostic intent; M1 model_validator enforces ok=True⇒error=None and ok=False⇒message_id=None; M2 duration_seconds bounded [0, 86400]; M3 HttpUrl caveat in module docstring; L1 ensure_tz_aware extracted to _validators.py + items.py refactored; L2 enum member docstrings added; L3 traceback_excerpt max_length=2000."
**Verification**: Quality gate clean (ruff, mypy strict). Boundary tests for SendResult cross-field, PipelineResult duration, FailureContext traceback length, shared tz-aware helper, Step 2/3 regression — all pass.
**Status**: Step 4 complete; no new TECH-DEBT (all issues fixed in-step).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 4 of 8

## Construction — models — Step 3 Complete (`models/briefing.py`)
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-27T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created src/investo/models/briefing.py (Briefing, BriefingNotification, TELEGRAM_MESSAGE_LIMIT) and src/investo/models/_validators.py (shared reject_blank_strict / reject_blank_preserve helpers). Refactored items.py to use the shared helper.
**Code review**: Sub-agent surfaced H1 (UTF-16 vs Python char count for Telegram limit, real reliability bug for emoji-containing summaries), M1 (model invariant disclaimer ∈ rendered_markdown), M2 (no date sanity bounds — project-wide), L1/L2 (validator duplication), L3 (HttpUrl → Url object footgun, downstream).
**User Input**: "fix high + L1/L2"
**AI Response**: "Applied: H1 replaced max_length=4096 with UTF-16 code-unit validator; L1/L2 extracted shared validators to _validators.py; M1/M2 registered as DEBT-001/DEBT-002 in docs/TECH-DEBT.md; L3 acknowledged for future u4 work."
**Verification**: Quality gate clean (ruff, mypy strict). UTF-16 boundary tests: 4096 ASCII / 4097 ASCII / 2048 emoji (=4096 UTF-16) / 2049 emoji (=4098 UTF-16) / mixed / Korean BMP — all behave correctly. Step 2 regression OK.
**Status**: Step 3 complete; 2 medium TECH-DEBT items added (DEBT-001 disclaimer-in-markdown invariant, DEBT-002 date sanity bounds).
**Context**: Construction phase Code Generation — models foundation, Step 3 of 8

**Action**: Created `src/investo/models/__init__.py` (placeholder) + `src/investo/models/items.py` with `Category` Literal and `NormalizedItem` pydantic v2 model. Sub-agent code review surfaced M1 (raw_metadata silent coercion) + M2 (whitespace handling); user chose "fix" → both applied in same step. Quality gate clean (ruff, mypy strict, runtime smoke + validator tests). Session log: docs/sessions/2026-04-27-models-code-generation-step2.md.
**User Input**: "fix" (in response to code review medium issues)
**AI Response**: "M1 strict union (StrictStr | StrictInt | StrictFloat for raw_metadata) + M2 (strip-reject blank source_name/title; normalize empty summary → None) applied in-place. Quality gate green."
**Status**: Step 2 complete; aidlc-state.md updated; no TECH-DEBT items added.

## Workflow Planning — Execution Plan
**Timestamp**: 2026-04-26T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Created aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md.
**Decisions**:
- Application Design: EXECUTE (5 components + plugin interface need definition)
- Units Generation: EXECUTE (4-5 units, incremental delivery)
- Functional Design: EXECUTE (selective per-unit — Briefing Generator + Source Adapters)
- NFR Requirements: EXECUTE (NFR-001~005 concrete acceptance)
- NFR Design: SKIP (covered by NFR Requirements at this scale)
- Infrastructure Design: SKIP (GitHub Actions YAML is the design)
- Code Generation: EXECUTE
- Build and Test: EXECUTE
**Risk**: Low (solo project, free dependencies, easy rollback via git revert).
**Extension compliance**: Security Baseline DECLINED (n/a); PBT PARTIAL applies to Code Generation and Build and Test (pure funcs + serialization round-trips).
**Context**: Stage 1 Step 11 — Workflow Planning artifact complete; awaiting user approval

## u56 Land — compliance-language-and-observational-tags
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-13T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Wave 8 land. All 9 plan steps `[x]`, FR-012 registered, 2089 → 2206 tests passed (+117; plan est. +52-68).
**Decisions**:
- ActionTag migrated 5→4 observation labels + `LEGACY_TAG_ALIASES` map; archive 재렌더 안 함 (법 소급 무).
- `DISCLAIMER_CRYPTO` 신규 (가상자산이용자보호법 §10·§19 reference); `append_disclaimer` / `verify_disclaimer` 시그니처 확장 — default 인자로 1-arg call site byte-compat (NFR-004 invariant 보존).
- P0 phrase catalogue + crypto-only subset (5 phrases) gated by `segment == "crypto"`.
- Context-aware demote: `진입/청산/편입` symmetric, `목표가` left-only quotative. 6-token window.
- First-viewport short disclaimer = additive gate (not substitute). Triple gate at publish: scan → first-viewport → canonical footer.
- Tone caps WARN-only (non-blocking) per NFR-003.
- Module boundary: phrase list in `models/compliance_phrases.py` (data layer — all units may import); gate in `publisher/compliance_language.py`; orchestrator only call site.
**Quality gate**: ruff clean / format clean (312 files) / mypy --strict (121 src) / pytest 2206 / mkdocs build --strict.
**DEBT 후보**: D56-A (`DISCLAIMER_CRYPTO` 변호사 검토), D56-B (KoNLPy 형태소 분석으로 종결 어미 정밀도 보강), D56-C (P0 phrase quarterly 갱신 cadence), D56-D (영문 quantified outcome regex 확장).
**Context**: AIDLC Construction Wave 8 Step land.

## u59 Step 1/3 Slice — macro metadata bridge and priority candidate preservation
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-23T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Implemented the first u59 construction slice. Added `src/investo/models/macro.py` as a flat-`raw_metadata` compatibility bridge for macro event key/status/priority, required macro actual detection, required section parsing, event date proximity, and compact prompt payload rendering. Updated `src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py` so Stage 1 prompt serialization includes a `macro` object only for macro-recognized items and `_select_llm_candidate_items(items, *, target_date=None)` reserves bounded P0/P1 macro items before generic candidate caps while preserving u58 official crypto-policy priority behavior.
**Decisions**:
- Kept `NormalizedItem` unchanged to avoid a broad model migration; no nested `raw_metadata` values introduced.
- Inferred P1 identity for existing official schedule sources (`fred-economic-calendar` release ids 10/46/50/53 and `fomc-calendar` FOMC rows) and P0 identity for existing `fred-macro` actual series (`CPIAUCSL`, `UNRATE`, `DFF`).
- Added `_MAX_LLM_MACRO_PRIORITY_ITEMS = 12` so macro preservation is bounded inside the existing 96-total / 24-per-source / 12-lookahead budget discipline.
- Pinned PPI schedule identity from existing FRED fixture (`release_id=46`, `Producer Price Index`, `2026-05-13`, `us-equity` routing). PPI actual source selection remains open; no FRED PPI series id was guessed.
**Quality gate**: `uv run pytest tests/unit/models/test_macro.py tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_unit.py tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_lookahead_render.py tests/unit/sources/test_fred_economic_calendar.py -q` → 82 passed. `uv run ruff check src/investo/models/macro.py src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py tests/unit/models/test_macro.py tests/unit/briefing/test_pipeline_unit.py tests/unit/sources/test_fred_economic_calendar.py` → clean. `uv run mypy --strict src/investo/models/macro.py src/investo/briefing/pipeline.py src/investo/sources/fred_economic_calendar.py` → clean.

## u41 Step 5 Follow-up — DART disclosure quiet-day reason
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-18T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Completed u41 Step 5 coverage reason-code follow-up. `dart-disclosure` zero-item outcomes now emit `DOMESTIC_DISCLOSURE_QUIET` for domestic-equity coverage instead of generic `SOURCE_ZERO` or a severity downgrade.
**Decisions**:
- Kept the implementation in `briefing/segments.py`, where `CoverageReasonCode` and segment reason derivation currently live.
- Treated successful zero-item OpenDART responses as a normal quiet disclosure day; failed DART outcomes continue to emit `SOURCE_FAILED`.
- Left u41 Step 6 manual dry-run pending because `OPENDART_API_KEY` was not present in the coding environment.
**Quality gate**: 53 coverage tests, scoped ruff, scoped mypy.
**Context**: u41 dart-disclosure-adapter Code Generation Step 5 complete; unit remains partial until operator dry-run.

## u107 Land — cftc-positioning-layer
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-18T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u107 code generation. Added official no-key CFTC COT/TFF positioning source coverage and delayed weekly presentation in the channel anchor block.
**Decisions**:
- Used official CFTC public reporting endpoints (`gpe5-46if` TFF futures-only and `72hh-3qpy` disaggregated futures-only) with bounded contract-code allow-lists.
- Dropped rows before the estimated public release datetime; Tuesday positions are treated as Friday 15:30 ET weekly delayed context with holiday delay handling.
- Routed `cftc-cot-positioning` items by contract group: equity/rates/FX/energy/metals/volatility to US-equity and crypto futures to crypto. Domestic investor-flow coverage remains owned by existing domestic sources.
- Extended `publisher.channel_anchor_block` rather than adding a new first-viewport surface.
**Quality gate**: 32 source/plugin/channel tests, 81 segment/aggregator tests, scoped ruff/format, strict mypy over sources+briefing+publisher, no-paid API check.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u108 Land - reader-facing-quality-language-boundary
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u108 code generation. Added shared reader-safe public quality language projection and extended the existing surface-quality gate to block raw diagnostic labels in public segment regions.
**Decisions**:
- Kept the owner in `src/investo/_internal/public_quality_language.py` so publisher, notifier, and visuals can share the same projection without crossing component ownership.
- Reused u100 `surface_quality` as the publish-boundary blocker instead of adding a second scanner.
- Moved public compact status chips away from raw `본문 사용`, `실패 N`, and `0건 N` counts while preserving those values in collapsed diagnostics and structured metadata.
- Updated site index hero, Telegram summary extraction, visual-card text cleaning, and quality sparkline empty-state copy to avoid reader-visible raw diagnostic terms.
**Quality gate**: 167 focused tests passed, scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u109 Land - domestic-anchor-sanity-quarantine
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u109 code generation. Added deterministic domestic exact-anchor quarantine before public anchor/prose/chart/visual/Telegram surfaces.
**Decisions**:
- Added `orchestrator.domestic_anchor_quarantine` as the in-process trust helper; no source adapter, network call, secret, dependency, workflow, or archive backfill was added.
- Applied quarantine before domestic KOSPI/KOSDAQ/USD-KRW anchors enter the canonical anchor payload.
- Reused u70 anchor assertion gate for exact Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix prose claims.
- Filtered Telegram market snapshots through the same trusted domestic registry path.
- Persisted bounded `domestic_anchor_withheld_count` and `domestic_anchor_withheld_reasons` fields through `QualitySnapshot`.
**Quality gate**: 295 focused tests passed, scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u110 Land - watchpoint-human-readability-v2
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u110 code generation. Cleaned public §⑥ watchpoint cards so
field labels, source values, triggers, and implication text render as
human-readable observations instead of template residue.
**Decisions**:
- Kept the u98 card shape and `render_watchpoint_matrix()` public signature
  unchanged.
- Normalized card fields inside `publisher.watchpoint_matrix` before
  templating: strip repeated field prefixes, promote valid source candidates,
  and display trigger text without `상방 상방` / `하방 하방`.
- Prefer explicit `상방:` / `하방:` clauses over semantic direction text so
  `상방 압력` remains in the current observation rather than being mistaken for
  a trigger label.
- Omit rows with hard-fail defects (missing source, missing trigger, identical
  triggers) and collapse all-invalid sections to the existing bounded note.
- Kept the Stage-2 prompt under the u101 byte budget while adding the u110
  no-duplicate-label / distinct-trigger rule.
**Quality gate**: 73 focused watchpoint/prompt/surface-quality tests passed,
scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u111 Land - watchlist-public-impact-language-cleanup
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u111 code generation. Public watchlist surfaces now render
reader-safe labels instead of raw matcher reason codes or alias provenance.
**Decisions**:
- Preserved `match_watchlist_items()` output and u73 Direct/Related/Uncertain/
  Rejected grouping semantics; this is a projection change only.
- Added canonical public projection helpers in `briefing.watchlist` and routed
  site/Telegram callouts, daily watchlist public sections, and visual-card rows
  through the same labels.
- Kept raw reason codes available inside collapsed diagnostics only; public
  Direct/Related sections no longer show `matched_alias`/`별칭` wording.
- Added a surface-quality block for public matcher reason leakage while
  preserving protected `<details>` diagnostics.
**Quality gate**: 288 focused watchlist/visual/notifier/surface-quality tests
passed, scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u112 Land - reader-markdown-polish-gate-v2
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u112 code generation. Extended the deterministic public
markdown polish gate for remaining first-viewport, link, numeric-emphasis, and
Korean particle artifacts.
**Decisions**:
- Extended the existing u100 `surface_quality` repair/block path rather than
  adding a second publish gate.
- Added safe repairs for fixed broken numeric-bold fragments and `민감도을`;
  residual malformed numeric emphasis, href ellipsis, malformed `수집창 [...]`
  watermark brackets, and bounded truncation residue now block.
- Updated number emphasis to wrap signed compound numeric tokens as one token.
- Summary extraction now rejects raw lines with blocking surface-quality issues
  before markdown cleanup can convert them into plausible summary text.
- Preserved protected-region behavior for code fences, tables, collapsed
  diagnostics, and disclaimers; `불강한성` remains covered by the existing u100
  repair path.
**Quality gate**: 79 focused surface/reader-format/segment-reader/summary tests
passed, scoped ruff passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u119 Land - adapter-contract-ports-cleanup
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-25T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u119 code generation. Removed the remaining pure shared-contract
sibling adapter imports by promoting stable contracts to `_internal` and
`models` while preserving legacy briefing import paths.
**Decisions**:
- Kept Functional Design and NFR Requirements skipped because this is a
  behavior-preserving architecture-boundary refactor with no new runtime
  dependency, source, secret, or cost surface.
- Made `_internal.summary_quality`, `_internal.disclaimer`, and
  `_internal.crypto_indicators` the canonical owners for pure shared contracts.
- Made `models.quality_history.QualityHistoryRow` the canonical quality-history
  row DTO while keeping `briefing.quality_eval` compatibility exports.
- Changed `briefing.numeric_verify` to depend on `models.core_fact` for
  `CORE_FACT_METADATA_PREFIX`, not the sources adapter package.
- Removed all pure shared-contract entries from the module-boundary allowlist.
- Accepted independent review findings by moving `MEANINGFUL_TEXT` into
  `_internal.text` and pinning the legacy `briefing.crypto_indicators` import
  path with an identity regression test.
**Quality gate**: 110 focused boundary/briefing/publisher/visual/model tests
passed, scoped ruff passed, scoped format check passed, `mypy src` passed.

## u120 Land - visual-asset-archive-context-boundary
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-25T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u120 code generation. Removed the hidden visuals-to-publisher
archive-root dependency by passing `ArchiveLayout` explicitly into visual asset
preparation and path helpers.
**Decisions**:
- Kept Functional Design and NFR Requirements skipped because this is a
  behavior-preserving dependency-direction cleanup over the existing visual
  publish path.
- Kept the mutable `publisher.paths.ARCHIVE_ROOT` seam at the orchestrator /
  publish boundary so existing production and test root redirection still work.
- Made `src/investo/visuals` independent of `investo.publisher` at both module
  level and function-body lazy-import level.
- Preserved relative markdown asset links, sidecar paths, curated asset copies,
  generated image behavior, and rollback-visible asset path collection.
**Quality gate**: 267 focused boundary/archive-layout/visual/orchestrator tests
passed, scoped ruff passed, scoped format check passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: None.

## u121 Land - publish-archive-path-normalization
**Timestamp**: 2026-06-25T00:00:00Z
**Action**: Landed u121 code generation. Normalized segmented publish archive
paths once after `write_briefing`, removing the absolute/relative branch that
made downstream side effects depend on test path shape.
**Decisions**:
- Kept Functional Design and NFR Requirements skipped because this is a
  bounded internal publish-path contract repair.
- Added `publisher.paths.normalize_archive_publish_path(...)` as the single
  pure helper for relative and absolute archive publish paths.
- Wrapped outside-root absolute paths as `PublisherIOError` so publish fails
  loudly and rollback behavior stays in the existing publish error channel.
- Updated side-effect tests to return absolute paths under the active archive
  root, proving index/heatmap/OG/quality/weekly paths still run after
  normalization.
- Resolved DEBT-062.
**Quality gate**: 134 focused publisher/orchestrator tests passed, scoped ruff
passed, scoped format check passed, `mypy src` passed.
**TECH-DEBT**: Resolved DEBT-062; no new debt.

## u132 Code Generation Step 1 - Watermark Stripper Trace
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:07:28Z
**Action**: Started u132 in a dedicated worktree and completed Code Generation Step 1.
**Decisions**:
- Confirmed `apply_reader_format()`, `reflow_first_viewport()`, and `repair_first_viewport_summary()` preserve the legacy half-open watermark.
- Identified `repair_surface_artifacts()` and its `_repair_unmatched_markdown_markers()` path as the production writer by spying on the actual full-chain call and asserting its before/after values.
- Kept the generic Markdown repair unchanged; u132 will correct the watermark producer and align the existing gate in later steps.
**Validation**: Focused segment reader-format regression added; 7 tests passed; scoped Ruff and format checks passed; fresh-eyes review found no remaining issues after the production-call spy was added. Plan/state/partial unit summary updated.
**Context**: User explicitly approved u132 execution in a separate worktree via `$dev-investo`.

## u132 Code Generation Step 2 - Reader-Facing Watermark Renderer
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:19:50Z
**Action**: Completed Code Generation Step 2 in the dedicated u132 worktree.
**Decisions**:
- Replaced mathematical `[start, end)` notation with `수집창 {start} ~ {end} (종료 미포함)` at the producer.
- Preserved the existing KST/NY/UTC market-window computation and changed presentation only.
- Deferred `_WATERMARK_LINE_RE` and `_bad_watermark_window` alignment to the explicit Step 3 boundary; Step 2 is not committed as a standalone production checkpoint.
**Validation**: Renderer expectations updated for all three segments and the full enhanced-header line; 47 focused tests passed; scoped Ruff and format checks passed; fresh-eyes review found no issues.
**Context**: Step 1 commit `6e21ba8` was pushed before this step began.

## u132 Code Generation Step 3 - Watermark Gate Alignment
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:22:27Z
**Action**: Completed Code Generation Step 3 in the dedicated u132 worktree.
**Decisions**:
- Re-aimed the existing `_WATERMARK_LINE_RE` at the exact KST/NY/UTC reader contract instead of adding a second gate family.
- Made every bold `기준 시각` line fail closed unless it matches the new contract; non-bold lookalike text remains outside the gate.
- Added explicit legacy `Z, Z)` and parenthesis-balance checks while preserving the existing `watermark.window_bracket` issue code.
**Validation**: Focused helper tests cover valid KST/NY/UTC shapes, missing `수집창`, the legacy dangling tail, and unbalanced parentheses; 68 focused tests passed; scoped Ruff and format checks passed; fresh-eyes review found no issues, and its NY-only residual risk was closed with direct KST/UTC acceptance cases.
**Context**: Step 2 commit `fe2df76` was pushed before this step began.

## u132 Code Generation Step 4 - Full-Chain Watermark Stability
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:39:13Z
**Action**: Completed Code Generation Step 4 in the dedicated u132 worktree.
**Decisions**:
- Used `_enhance_reader_experience()` with a complete six-section body instead of injecting a hand-authored watermark into the publisher test.
- Compared the exact producer line after summary repair, surface repair, and the full segment reader chain; unrelated document normalization is outside this line-level byte-stability contract.
- Updated only the shared integration fixture touched by this test from its obsolete abbreviated watermark; the repository-wide consumer sweep remains Step 6.
- Preserved and asserted `Briefing.target_date` and disclaimer model fields across the chain.
**Validation**: 35 integration/focused tests passed; scoped Ruff and format checks passed; fresh-eyes review found no remaining issues after the producer-to-chain assertion was strengthened.
**Context**: Step 3 commit `d05f798` was pushed before this step began.

## u132 Code Generation Step 5 - Publish-Gate Regressions
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:44:37Z
**Action**: Completed Code Generation Step 5 in the dedicated u132 worktree.
**Decisions**:
- Exercised `apply_reader_format_to_segments()` so tests observe the actual `SurfaceQualityError` boundary rather than only the private helper predicate.
- Pinned the exact public 2026-06-30 legacy line and a missing-closing-parenthesis new line as blocking evidence.
- Required exactly one `watermark.window_bracket` issue with evidence equal to the malformed input line.
- Made `_briefing()` target-date configurable and aligned all u132 fixtures to 2026-06-30 after fresh-eyes review.
**Validation**: 38 integration/focused tests passed; scoped Ruff and format checks passed; fresh-eyes re-review found no remaining issues.
**Context**: Step 4 commit `0e15927` was pushed before this step began.

## u132 Code Generation Step 6 - Watermark Consumer Sweep
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T19:57:15Z
**Action**: Completed Code Generation Step 6 in the dedicated u132 worktree.
**Decisions**:
- Swept every `기준 시각` occurrence under `src/` and `tests/`; confirmed `_internal/briefing_extract.py` is prefix-only and does not parse the window syntax.
- Updated seven general test consumers to the new `수집창 ... ~ ... (종료 미포함)` contract while preserving explicit legacy-invalid repair and gate regressions.
- Reused `_render_timestamp_watermark()` in variable-date and variable-segment archive fixtures so their timezone and UTC window cannot drift from the producer.
- Excluded unrelated generated archive/site changes observed in the shared worktree from the u132 keep-set.
**Validation**: 200 focused/integration tests passed; scoped Ruff and format checks and `git diff --check` passed; fresh-eyes final review found no issues after three fixture-consistency findings were corrected.
**Context**: Step 5 commit `166f002` was pushed before this step began.

## u132 Code Generation Step 7 - Final Quality Gate
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T20:03:12Z
**Action**: Completed Code Generation Step 7 and the u132 Code Generation stage in the dedicated worktree.
**Decisions**:
- Ran Ruff/format over all 13 Python files changed since the pre-u132 baseline, plus `mypy src` and the planned internal/briefing/publisher pytest scope.
- Classified the two failing tests as existing DEBT-081 only after reproducing both unchanged at baseline commit `0af9c7a`; u132 does not modify either failing surface.
- Re-ran the planned pytest scope with only those two baseline failures deselected to prove all other 1,440 tests pass.
- Kept unrelated generated archive/site worktree changes outside the u132 diff; AC-132.5 remains satisfied.
**Validation**: Ruff/format passed; `mypy src` passed for 226 files; pytest returned 1,440 passed plus 2 baseline-identical failures, then 1,440 passed with those tests deselected; cumulative fresh-eyes review found no issues and confirmed AC-132.1 through AC-132.5.
**TECH-DEBT**: No new item; DEBT-081 remains active and unchanged.
**Context**: Step 6 commit `843d191` was pushed before this step began. Cross-check is pending.

## u132 Cross-Check Complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-07-17T20:06:52Z
**Scope**: u132 watermark-window-reader-render-and-gate-alignment against FR-002, FR-003, FR-008, FR-009, NFR-006, the unit DoD, and AC-132.1 through AC-132.5.
**Result**: APPROVE, 100% compliance; no gaps or new TECH-DEBT items.
**Evidence**:
- Current-HEAD focused cross-check suite: 100 passed.
- Scoped Ruff/format and `mypy src` passed; Step 7's 1,440-test clean remainder remains valid.
- Cumulative diff contains no archive or generated-site paths.
- Existing DEBT-081 failures reproduce unchanged at the pre-u132 baseline and are not u132 gaps.
**Report**: `docs/cross-checks/2026-07-18-u132-watermark-window-reader-render-and-gate-alignment.md`
**Context**: Step 7 commit `8682b94` was pushed before cross-check began.
