"""KST cron-time → US trading-day mapping (US-005, AC-005-1 ~ AC-005-3).

The GitHub Actions schedule fires twice per week:

* KST 평일 07:00 (Mon-Fri morning) — for the prior US trading session
* KST 토요일 09:00 — for Friday's US trading session

In both cases the **target date** is the most recent KST weekday that
the US market closed on, walking back from the current KST calendar
date.

Per ``weekday_only_us_close=True`` (default), the function guarantees
the returned date is a weekday (Mon-Fri); on Mondays this means
skipping the weekend back to Friday. Set ``False`` to return ``kst_today
- 1 day`` raw — useful only for manual ``workflow_dispatch`` runs that
want to inspect a specific cron-fire's behavior, never for the
production cron path.

US public holidays (Thanksgiving, July 4, Memorial Day, etc.) are
**deliberately not consulted** (per Q3=A in u5 NFR Requirements +
``tech-stack-decisions.md`` TS-4 / TS-10): adding
``pandas_market_calendars`` would bring transitive ``pandas`` +
``numpy`` dependencies (~tens of MB) for a 1-person zero-cost tool
where the operator can manually re-run on the ~10 affected days per
year. Holiday-day pipelines naturally surface as empty-collect →
``EmptyCollectError`` → operator alert (per AC-003-2).

    Parameters
    ----------
    now_utc:
        The cron fire time as a timezone-aware UTC ``datetime``. A naive
        ``datetime`` raises ``ValueError`` at the type boundary because
        the date arithmetic depends on knowing the offset (the cron
        schedule is anchored in KST, but the input from ``datetime
        .now(UTC)`` arrives in UTC).
    weekday_only_us_close:
        When ``True`` (default; matches the production cron path), the
        returned date is always a weekday — Mondays roll back to Friday,
        Sundays (if reached via manual trigger) walk back to Friday too.
        When ``False``, returns ``kst_today - 1 day`` raw.

    Returns
    -------
    date
        The KST calendar date of the target US trading session. Always
        ``< kst_today``.

    Raises
    ------

        unforgiving of naive datetimes — fail loudly at the boundary.
