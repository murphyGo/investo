### Medium Priority

#### DEBT-001: `Briefing` model lacks `disclaimer ∈ rendered_markdown` invariant

- **Created**: 2026-04-27
- **Source**: Code review of `src/investo/models/briefing.py` (Step 3)
- **Reference**: NFR-004 (compliance / disclaimer enforcement)
- **Description**: The `Briefing` pydantic model permits a state where `disclaimer` text is not actually present in `rendered_markdown`. Today the only enforcement is `publisher.verify_disclaimer` (called pre-publish). Defense-in-depth would shift the guarantee one layer earlier — into the data model — so the bug class becomes impossible by construction.
- **Suggested Fix**: Add a `model_validator(mode="after")` on `Briefing` that asserts `self.disclaimer.strip() in self.rendered_markdown`. Trade-off: rejects ambiguous test fixtures that pass section text without re-running the rendering pipeline. Either weaken the check (substring of the disclaimer's first line) or update fixtures to always pass full rendered markdown.
- **Effort**: ~30 min including fixing fixtures
- **Priority Reasoning**: Medium — not yet a real bug because the publisher guard exists, but if anyone ever bypasses the publisher path (e.g., direct unit-tests, future replays, ADR'd alternate flow), the guard disappears.

#### DEBT-002: No date sanity bounds on `target_date` / `published_at` (project-wide)

- **Created**: 2026-04-27
- **Source**: Code review of `src/investo/models/briefing.py` (Step 3); same pattern in `items.py`
- **Reference**: US-005 (scheduled execution), FR-006 (archival)
- **Description**: `Briefing.target_date`, `BriefingNotification.target_date`, and `NormalizedItem.published_at` accept any valid date — including far-future (`date(2206, 4, 27)`) or pre-epoch values. A typo upstream would commit nonsensical archive paths or stamp items with bad timestamps.
- **Suggested Fix**: Add sanity bounds at the **orchestrator** boundary (`resolve_target_date`) rather than in the models, since the models are also used in historical replays where wider bounds may be needed. Concrete check: `2024-01-01 ≤ target_date ≤ today + 1`. For Source Adapters, reject items whose `published_at` is more than 30 days in the future.
- **Effort**: ~15 min in u5 orchestrator; ~10 min in u1 sources base.
- **Priority Reasoning**: Medium — defensive only; would catch upstream typos but does not currently block any real flow.

### Low Priority

#### DEBT-003: `retry_get` 5 MB body cap is post-hoc, not streaming

- **Created**: 2026-04-27
- **Source**: Code review of `src/investo/sources/_retry.py` (Step 3)
- **Reference**: NFR-007 AC-7.1 (5 MB response body cap)
- **Description**: `retry_get` checks `len(response.content) > max_response_bytes` after `httpx.AsyncClient.get()` has already buffered the full body into memory. A hostile server returning a 100 MB payload would briefly hold 100 MB resident before the cap fires. Acceptable for v1 because the only adapter (FOMC RSS, Step 8) returns < 200 KB; would matter if a future adapter pulled larger feeds or hit a hostile endpoint.
- **Suggested Fix**: Switch to `client.stream("GET", url)` and (a) reject up-front if `Content-Length` header exceeds the cap, (b) accumulate via `aiter_bytes()` and abort once the running total exceeds the cap. Trade-off: streaming requires constructing a synthetic `httpx.Response` to return, since downstream callers expect a fully-buffered response.
- **Effort**: ~1 hour including test updates (need a streaming MockTransport response).
- **Priority Reasoning**: Low — the threat is "hostile server returning huge body", which is unlikely against the curated free-tier endpoints `u1` consumes. Re-evaluate when a non-RSS adapter (e.g. JSON market data) lands.

#### DEBT-004: `_sanitize.py` depends on `bleach` (maintenance-mode)

- **Created**: 2026-04-27
- **Source**: Code review of `src/investo/sources/_sanitize.py` (Step 4)
- **Reference**: NFR-007 AC-7.2 (sanitization library)
- **Description**: `bleach>=6` is in maintenance-only mode and the maintainers have publicly recommended `nh3` (Rust-based, actively maintained) as the successor. Today bleach 6 is correct and behaves as we expect; the risk is future EOL or accumulating `DeprecationWarning`s from the underlying `html5lib`.
- **Suggested Fix**: When bleach hits EOL, replace `bleach.clean(text, tags=[], strip=True, strip_comments=True)` with `nh3.clean_text(text)` (or `nh3.clean(text, tags=set())` for HTML output). Single-function module makes the migration trivial. Update the pipeline so HTML entities still decode and whitespace still collapses.
- **Effort**: ~30 min including test updates and verifying nh3 entity-decoding behavior.
- **Priority Reasoning**: Low — the project's only sanitization need is plain-text output; bleach 6 is fine for v1. Watch for EOL announcements or CI deprecation warnings.
